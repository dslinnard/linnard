        <h1>The Pizza Guillotine</h1>

        <p class="margin-bottom-30">An end-grain cutting board by day, a pizza guillotine by night. Board is made of California Black Oak, Bubinga &amp; Padauk. Scaffolding is made from Padauk. Blade is stainless steel with carbon fibre mounts which hold two bearings on each side. Dampers were cast from silicone. This is one of two in existance.</p>

        <p>The guillotine gets quite a lot of use on Bastille day.</p>

        <p>Probably about 40 hours of work. If I were to make another one I would probably charge $800.</p>
