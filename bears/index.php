        <h1>Handmade bears, mostly for new &amp; old humans</h1>

        <p>If you want a lovely bear that will last for years and can be repaired if need be, I'd recommend making one yourself. These bears were based on the book,  <em>"The Complete Book of Teddy-Bear Making Techniques"</em> by Alicia Merrett and Ann Stephens (ISBN-13: 978-0762403493). </p>

        <p>I always try and make an accessory for each bear which is usually based on a fond traint of the parents.</p>
