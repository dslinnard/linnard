        <blockquote>Keep it simple, keep it local.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>There is no excess in nature, everything has been pared 
        down and has function, yet the result is elegant.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>I believe that elegance and functionality should exist in symbiosis. 
        Everything reduced to it's simplest form, with elegance absorbing 
        functionality and vice a versa, until the line between them fades.</blockquote>
