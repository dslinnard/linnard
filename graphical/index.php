		<h1>Skylon, Heralding in the Next Era of Travel</h1>

		<p>With the demise of the Airmail stamp in the USA it seemed fitting to pay tribute to the bold challenge that <a href="http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/space_skylon.html">Reaction Engines</a> have taken up, that of a reusable, runway to space, high altitude aircraft. </p>

		<p>This graphics project is a joint project with <a href="http://www.lukegraves3d.com/">Luke Graves</a> who kindly did most of the work, including original 3d modelling.</p>

		<p>I did a short run of sticker sheets (60 stickers per sheet) and mailed then to <a href="http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/space_skylon.html">Reaction Engines</a>. I did hold back a few sheets which can be purchased for &pound;7.50/$10. Please <a href="/contact/index.php">email me</a> if you are interested.</p>
