        <h2 id="a<?php echo $i++;?>">&sect;1. Moulding flat panel</h2>

        <h3>&sect;1.1 Layup</h3>

        <p>Panel is made of a single layer of twill and veil, 12&quot;x18&quot;. I
        added the veil to help fill in any holes in the twill and help stop the
        AwlBrite bleeding through. The veil is quite important as I am currently wet
        sanding an AwlBrite coated shell (no veil) and there are little pin holes where I can see straight through. They are filled will epoxy, but I hope when I pull the peel ply off that it doesn't leave holes (it did not). It would be nice if I could make two panels in one go.</p>

        <p>I have started to use fiberglass veil as the carbon is too expensive.</p>

        <h3>&sect;1.2 Getting the perfect finish</h3>

        <p>When moulded against glass the finished surface has very small voids which
        run along the fibre sides. I can fill these with the polyuranthane, but it's a
        pain. The following are methods I have tried in order to reduce the voids.</p>

        <h4>&sect;1.2.1 Massaging the fabric</h4>

        <p>Not as fun as it sounds. I spoke with Craig at Berkeley marina and he suggested massaging the fabric once it's down on the glass. I tried this and it did reduce the voids and some small areas were perfect, however it would still need coating to fill the remaing voids. </p>

        <h4>&sect;1.2.3 Precoating glass with epoxy</h4>

        <p>I did try spraying the waxed glass with hair spray and then applying a thin layer of epoxy by brush, allowing this to cure till touch dry before applying the carbon etc. This worked great and the voids were reduced by about 95%. The downside of this was that the resulting sheet was about twice as thick and when I formed the lips, I had a slight rippling. I am still getting slight rippling in MC6 which didn't have the initail layer of epoxy which I think now is caused by forcing the carbon into the curvature. </p>

        <h4>&sect;1.2.4 Reverse layup</h4>
        <p>My latest attempt is to lie the veil onto peel ply (I taped a ruler to the
        edge of the peel ply so I could lift the ply and carbon without distoring it),
        soaked it in resin and rolled it to make sure the epoxy (I used the slow cure)
        saturated the cloth, then applied the carbon twill, saturated it and rolled
        again. I let it sit for maybe twenty minutes to give the resin time to soak into the fibres and then rolled again. I then turned it over onto the glass and rolled again. The results of this were almost as good as my previous approach of adding an initial resin layer. When I was doing my test piece I coated the waxed glass with hair spray. This leaves a matt finish to the carbon which may give a better surface for the polyurathane to bond to.</p>

        <h4>&sect;1.2.5 Double layup</h4>
        <p>I tried making a double sized panel, but I had some rather ghastly voids even though I rolled it thoroughly (7 passes). I put this down to either using fast epoxy (it may have started to cure before I vacuum bagged it) or not doing a reverse layout.</p>

        <p>I re-did a single sheet, waxing the glass, doing a reverse layout (peel ply, veil, twill), using slow epoxy, coating the glass with epoxy and rolling between layers and although I had no big voids, I had the usual small voids everywhere. I couldn't understand this so I decided to do some test pieces using glass coated with my spray release film (all were rolled):</p>

        <ul><li>Exhibit A. twill, veil &amp; ply</li>
        <li>Exhibit B. epoxy, twill, veil &amp; ply</li>
        <li>Exhibit C. ply, veil, twill (reverse layout) &amp; epoxy on glass</li></ul>

        <p>All exhibits came out the same and had voids everywhere just as my previous sheet. What I did notice however was that in both cases when I returned the following day the vacuum had gone out of the bag, so I suspect that if the vacuum goes before the resin has cured the carbon fibres expand and suck out the epoxy between the threads, leading to the voids. I am going to do one more test, using fast epoxy (as I don't want to wait all night), but waiting long enough for the epoxy to gel. The glass I am using is half coated in wax, the other half uncoated. I shall use the same application method as exhibit C.</p>

        <p>The results of this were better than the single sheet above, I did get the small voids everywhere but they were smaller. Also the non-waxed piece came out  slightly better with ever so slightly smaller voids, however it was very difficult to get off the glass.</p>

        <p>I'm looking at the piece with the ghastly voids and if you ignore them then the piece came out a lot better with only a hint of the smaller voids. I think I got the big voids because it took a long time to lay everything down and the resin started to gel before it went into the vacuum bag, but I think I got the better surface because I rolled it well and the resin had time to saturate the carbon. I ought to do another test, using a reverse layout and epoxied glass all rolled well, but using slow epoxy and giving the resin time to soak in before I but it in the vacuum bag. I did this in MC7 with good results.</p>

        <p>For MC7 I waxed and hairsprayed the glass, taped a ruler to the peel ply and over the glass applied the veil, resin and rolled it, twill, resin and rolled it. Let it sit for 15 minutes, rolled it again and then turned it over onto the glass and bagged it. I stayed there for at least 3 hours with the pump running and it came out great.</p>

        <h2 id="a2">&sect;2. Coating &amp; polishing the panel</h2>

        <h3>&sect;2.1 Coating</h3>

        <p>Leaving the peel ply on throughout the coating and polishing helps prevent
        AwlBrite bleed through. Whether it's a good idea to leave it on throughout the polishing I'm not sure as I need the surface as flat as possible. I  at least need to sand down the ply slightly as you find small pin sized points of epoxy due to the release film. </p>

        <p>After letting the epoxy cure for 7 to 10 days I washed the carbon with soapy
        water and a tooth brush. I repeated this twice, washing in the shower between
        scrubs. Once dry I wiped down with AwlGrip surface cleaner (TP0115). On MC6 I
        applied 4 layers of AwlBrite, three in one day and one the following morning. I
        did enough coats to fill all the tiny little voids. I did not sand between
        coats.</p>

        <p>After this has cured for maybe a week I noticed that I could see the little
        horizontal and vertical voids again. I put this down to the AwlBrite shrinking
        during it's cure. They are shallow and I think I can sand them almost out. I
        started sanding with 2500 grit but this was too slow as was 2000, 1500 seems to
        be the ideal grit. After sanding I could still see the vertical and horizontal
        marks but they were very shallow. Once I got a pretty blemish free surface I
        added 2 final coats of AwlBrite. This surface should be almost perfect (as it is) apart from the odd bit of dust. I will leave this for at least 5 days before
        polishing. It may have been easier just to add a few more layers of Awlbrite before all the sanding as I really want to sand as little as possible.</p>

        <p>My current plan is to put on 4 inital coats of Awlbrite, once it's cured for a few days I remove each dust spot with 2500 grit wet and dry. I wet down the surface and locate the spots with my fingers.</p>

        <p>After the final coat of Awlbrite, I place a protective sheet of glass over the sheet to prevent any dust falling onto the surface. I still got some dust but in MC7 but only 4 or 5 spots which I removed with 2500 grit wet and dry. Even with 2500 grit paper it still leaves swirl marks so it will need polishing. I am hoping for MC7 that I can just use the finest polishing compound.</p>

        <h3>&sect;2.2 Polishing</h3>

        <p>My polishing notes seem to change everytime I polish a panel and I have just came to realise that this is because it depends on how I sand it, the coaser the grit, the more polishing I have to do. I spoke to Pinnacle and they told be that Fine #2 should remove 2500 grit and if not #3 should do it. Based on this knowledge I should be able to choose the polishing compound based on the grit used. I understand now that I should always use the finest grit possible. My polishing notes are going to be based on a per handbag basis.</p>

        <h3>&sect;2.2.1 Polishing MC7</h3>
        <p>MC7 had a few dust particles after the final coat which I removed these with 2500 grit. I polished twice with #2 and each time I could still see the areas where I had sanded, these areas looked dull and I could see swirl marks. I next polished with #3, it looks better but I can still see swirl marks however, I will polish with #2 next before trying #3 again.</p>

        <h3>&sect;2.2.2 Polishing MC6</h3>
        <p>Before polishing I rubbed down with 1500 grit to remove the dust. I first polished with heavy, #3, #2 and finally Nu-wax. The result, though glossy &amp; highly reflective, still showed the little lumps where the dust particles were so I sanded again with 1500 grit and then went over it a few times with the heavy compound. This time I pressed the polishing pad down fairly hard and the result was a nice matt surface clear of any dust particles. I think the secret here was the extra pressure. I can still see some scratches which I probably added when I sanded down the dust particles. I ought to be more careful about creating a dust free environment or use a finer grit. Overall MC6 loolked okay but I think I could have got it glossier. Still need to master the polishing process.</p> 

        <p>After polishing with intermediate and fine compounds, I apply a layer of
        Nu-wax and a layer of release wax in case any epoxy gets on the surface.</p>



        <h2 id="a3">&sect;3. Creating the curved lip</h2>

        <h3>&sect;3.1 The mould</h3>

        <p>The mould is 34.2cm wide and should be at least 14&quot; long. The 9/16&quot; router bit was set to give a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagitta_%28geometry%29">sagitta</a> of 2mm.</p>

        <h3>&sect;3.2 Layup</h3>

        <p>Side pieces start from 7.5cm &amp; and 8cm from the center line. New
        approach is to keep the sides fairly thin. These pieces will eventually be
        covered up so I use TAP plain cf. Because I have to mould a flat sheet around a
        curve, I tape the sheet securely to the mould before applying the carbon.
        Taping it is also necessary as I need to line up the above pieces of cf. The
        peel ply, release film, breather etc. all help secure it. It's a good idea to
        have the sheet wrap as far as possible around the mould as this helps stop
        resin creeping onto the finished surface. I may increase the thickness of the
        mould to help this further.</p>


        <p>In making MC2 I followed the above layup but the sides were flexible. For
        MC3 and all further bags I use an extra layer of plain, starting at 8.5cm from
        the center. Because the hinge tube is enclosed within the clip by another tube,
        I need to make sure that the hinge tube isn't too close to the outer surface. I
        think about 1mm will be fine. I add this extra layer of plain after the initial
        2 layers have cured as it's easier to lay it down once the curve is set. On one
        lip I made I put three layers down at once and ended up having ripples in it,
        though that was probably because I didn't smooth down the breather. </p>

        <h3>&sect;3.2.1 Layup MC7</h3>
        <p>For MC7 the bag is a little wider and has to start curving at a higher point so I start 5mm higher for this bag, thus the first two side pieces will start at 
        8cms &amp; and 8.5cm (30 x 13cm) and the final piece starting at 9cm (30 x 12cm).</p>

        <p>Note, on MC6 after removing it from the mould I noticed that ther surface had slight whitish marks. This may be because I coated and polished the carbon with mould release. I shall try and remove this with the fine polishing compound. Maybe in future I ought to wrap the mould in mylar? About a week later the surface looked fine.</p>

        <p>Once the third layer has set I can add the uni. This is a good time to add
        it as the lip is formed and I know exactly how the fibres line up (I noticed on
        an earlier bag that it would twist slightly when I bent it into shape, which
        could have been due to the direction of the fibres). I added the whole 12&quot;
        width. I probably should cover the whole panel in uni, using multiple pieces so
        I get a uniform thickness without a lip (12&quot; is the maxiumum thickness I
        can buy this uni in). In MC7 I noticed that when I use the whole width of uni, when I eventually add the final twill over it, the binding threads are imprinted on the surface so it's probably best not to ue the full width. In some bags I 
        also added veil on top of this to help hold the uni cf. in place, though I don't 
        think this is necesary and won't add it in future unless I find a reason.</p>

        <p>The binding threads on the TAP uni are quite thick and standed proud on the
        finished piece. I am looking at different vendors of uni carbon. I recently
        bought some from Soller Composites (www.solarcomposites.com), 9oz and 4.1oz.
        The binding threads on these are finer. I shall use the 4.1oz on MC3 and
        further bags as the 9oz feels thick. Always have the binding threads on top so
        I can sand them down.</p>

        <p>Once the uni has cured, sand down the sides and lip, filling any voids or
        steps I come across with epoxy. To make the shell more manageable and enable the lip to be sanded with my curved sanding blocks, I initially
        trim the lip off at height of 1.5&quot; and sheet width of 10.5". If the bag ever becomes too stiff I may want to bend it before the uni is fully cured.</p>



        <h2 id="a4">&sect;4. Installing the hinge tube</h2>


        <h3>&sect;4.1 Positioning the tube</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest problems I have is knowing where to place the hinge tube. I got the position wrong twice with MC1, so on MC2 I drew out the profile of the
        curve etc and combined with measurements from MC1 I calculated where the tube
        should go. Again I got it wrong by 3.5mm. At least on MC6 I am using the same
        mould as MC5 so I should be able to compare the position or make a jig, line
        them up etc. The width of the lip was about 1/4" wider than on MC2 so on MC6 I have moved the hinge tube in. With the shell on the mdf mould I set the top of the tube at 18mm vertically below the upper surface of the shell. I use a combination square with rule extending 18mm when placing the tube and to ensure it was straight, I positioned it against a ruler held in place by spring clips. I glued the tube in place with super glue. On MC7 &amp; MC8 I used small drops of epoxy.</p>

        <p>On MC7 &amp; 8 I placed the hinge tube top at 18mm but on MC9 I may move it to 19 or 20mm. I will see how MC7 &amp; 8 turn out.</p>

        <h3>&sect;4.2 The tube</h3>
        <p>MC1 had a carbon tube (I sanded down a 2mm tube to 1.6mm) running along it's
        length, however due to the minimal thickness I have in the lip, MC2 will have a
        polymide tube which is extremely thin (0.0403 ID, 0.001 WL or in metric 1mm OD
        - part number 040-12 from SmallParts). The polymide tubes are very expensive so
        I am now using the original 2mm tube (sanded down to 1.6mm) for the hinge pin
        tube. MC5 has this as will MC6.</p>

        <p>The hinge tube running through the clip used to pass through a larger carbon
        tube and because I didn't want the larger tube showing through the bottom of
        the clip, I had to set a minimum distance that the hinge tube should be from
        the outside shell. This distance used to be about 1.5mm but as the outer tube
        in the clip is going to be a very thin walled section of polymide tube
        (Polyimide Triple Wall Tubing AWG 12, .0808&quot; ID x .0030 WL, .0868&quot; OD
        sku TWPT-080), I have reduced this to about 1mm (see building the lip).</p>


        <h3>&sect;4.1 Continuous hinge tube</h3>
        <p>I did think about doing away with the hinged spring pin and use one
        continuous hinge pin, in which case I wouldn't have to worry too much about the
        depth of the tube in the lip. I do like the spring clip and how would I stop
        the long hinge pin coming out? For now I will stick with the spring pins. </p>



        <h2 id="a5">&sect;5. Making the bottom insert</h2>


        <h3>&sect;5.1 Mold, MC2 - MC6</h3>

        <p>The inside profile of the mold was based upon a flat section of 1 7/8&quot; with a diameter of 1 3/4&quot;. The outside mould profile is 1 7/8&quot; flat section and curves of diameter 1 7/8&quot;. The length of the inner mould is approximately 8.5&quot; long.</p>

        <h3>&sect;5.2 Mold, MC7</h3>
        <p>The mould for MC7 is being re-designed and the inner mold will be built from acrylic and the outer from fibreglass. Because the dimenisions of the outer mould are more important than those of the inner mould I am concentrating my efforts on getting this as perfect as possible. The radius of both molds will be 1&quot;. As discussed in &sect;8. to achive a flat apex of 3mm each radius has to be moved in y = 1mm, thus the total width of the acrylic for the outer mould needs to be:</p>

        <div class="equ">4 x 25.4 - 2 x y</div>

        <div class="equ">4 x 25.4 - 2 =&gt; 101.6 - 2 = 99.6mm wide</div>

        <p>Because I am making the outer mold and inner moulds with the same radius this will causes a problem, with the gap between them the same at 180&deg; and 270&deg; but narrowing in between. The narrowest point is at 225&deg; and is equal to:</p>

         <div class="equ">y=z.Cos45&deg; where z is the amount we shift each circle</div>

        <p>Thus if I move the inner circle in and up by 1.25mm, the gap shrinks to 0.88mm at 45&deg;. So that I don't get areas where the carbon is too thick for the mould I can reduce the width of the carbon so it tapers off as the curvature increases. I turns out that the bottom mould for MC6 reaches a depth of 18mm which so happens to be the height of a 1&quot; circle at 45&deg;. So for MC7 I would have only 3 or 4 layers would wrapping to 225&deg; with the remain layers warrping less than this.</p>

        <p>I will move the circles of the inner mould in by 1.25mm each. This means that the acrylic for the inner mould needs to be:</p>
        <div class="equ">99.6 - 2.5 = 97.1mm wide.</div> 

        <p>The length of the inner mould for MC6 is 218mm. I see no reason to change this. The acrylic for the outer mould needs to be 2.5mm longer however, because the outer mould needs to be cut in half I will make it 6mm longer to accommodate any length lost during the cutting and sanding.</p>

        <p>Before I cut the acrylic make an mdf mould to check measurements against and to make sure the current shell fits around it.</p>

        <h3>&sect;5.2.1 Acrylic Molds, MC7</h3>
        <p>I tried to cut them out as accurate as possible 99.6mm for the outer mould and 97.1mm for the inner mould. I took measurements from each end of the machined acrylic and this is what I got:</p>

        <div class="equ">Outer: 99.79mm &amp; 99.49mm a difference of 0.3mm, average = 99.64mm &gt; y = 0.98mm</div>

        <div class="equ">Inner: 97.17mm &amp; 97.06mm a difference of 0.11mm, average = 97.11mm</div>

        <p>Both of these are as near perfect as I am going to get them. Next stage is to sand them smooth and build them up.</p>

        <p>The current length of the inner mould as best as I can measure is 217mm. I recalculated what I think it should be using the inner length of exisiting side panels which need to fit over it. My calculations are:</p>

        <div class="equ">Lenth of inner bottom panel mould = inner length of side panel (222mm) - 2 x thickness of ultrasuede (0.5mm)  - 2 x thickness of bottom panel ends (1.5mm) - 2 x 0.5mm (to give us an extra little gap)</div>

        <div class="equ">= 222 - 2 x 0.5 - 2 x 1.5 - 2 x 0.5 = 222 - 1 - 3 - 1 = 217mm</div>

        <p>Thus we have the inner mould cut to 217mm and the outer mould 225mm which is  few mm longer to take into account any length I loose in cutting it.</p>

         
        <h3>&sect;5.3 Layup</h3>

        <p>The bottom and end plates are now molded into a single piece, using 5
        layers, one of twill, the rest uni and plain. I did try making one with 4 layers to try and reduce the extra thicknesses introduced by the gussets. The piece came out fine, nice and thin, a little flexible but how strong do I really need it. I have decided to standardise on 5 layers for the side and bottom panels. The plain carbon I use is a new type of carbon which is supposed to mould well to complex shapes (5.5oz 4HS carbon from US Composites).</p>

        <p>MC6 used 2xtwill, 2xHS4 and 1xuni. I don't know why I used twill
        on the outside as you won't see it. For MC7 I will use 1xtwill, 2xHS4 and
        2xuni. Note I need to use carbon that will easily shape itself to curves, the
        uni I used had a very loose weave. Size is 48 x 14cm.</p>

        <p>When moulding this piece I use slow setting epoxy to give time for the
        bubbles to escape and I take my time laying out the carbon fiber making sure
        the gussets in the cloth are at a minimal. I mold the piece upright to allow any
        bubbles to escape. The one for MC1 came out fine, but the one for MC2 came out
        a little thick towards the ends. Maybe I could have pushed down the two mould
        pieces harder?</p>

        <p>For MC7 size was 48 x 14cm.</p>

        <p>The main problems I have with this part are making it without voids and getting a uniform thickness.</p>

        <h3>&sect;5.4 Voids and uneven thickness</h3>

        <p>The puckering of the fabric around the corners causes this problem as it
        increases the thickness and creates voids. In MC6 I am trying to reduce this by
        using narrower pieces of carbon and using carbon that drapes well. For MC6 I
        used 2xtwill, 2xHS4 and 1xuni, where the uni was one I had with a loose weave
        (probably from TAP). The pieces I used were 50cm x 13cm. I rolled each layer which seems to have helped as the surface came out pretty good and without too many voids. For MC7 I had no internal voids but had external ones. Ideally I would make a new mould that was wider and had a shallower curves but this may take a while. Curently I am thinking of cutting the fabric where it gussets so I don't get the extra build up of fabric.</p>

        <p>I did try making one with four layers and used a new type of carbon which is
        supposed to mold well to complex shapes (5.5oz 4HS carbon from US Composites).
        The piece came out fine, nice and thin, a little flexible but how strong do I
        really need it. I didn't use this mould but it may be worth making another one sometime.</p>


        <p>On MC6 I did paint surface with black paint to fill the few remaining voids, but sanding back is hard work and after I sanded it off I could still see the voids. In future just coat with AwlBrite until they are filled. Using the rolling during application of the carbon really reduces the voids.</p>

        <p>The current panel was coated in AwlBrite (3 coats), but this was after
        putting down an initial 2 coats and sanding back to carbon in order to remove
        the tiny gaps. Sanding back and coating was time consuming so the next bag
        will have a plain carbon finish. As well as saving time, the plain carbon
        finish won't show up scratches as much as the gloss finish. Instead of using
        AwlBrite to fill the gaps and sanding back I am now using black undercoat and
        sanding back which is a quick simple process. I will see how the matt finish
        looks on MC5 before deciding on the interior of MC6.</p>

        <p>MC6a: 2xtwill, 2xHS4, 1xloose weave uni. &amp; fast setting epoxy.</p>

        <p>MC6b: 1xtwill, 3xHS4, 1xloose weave uni. &amp; fast setting epoxy.</p>

        <p>MC7: 1xtwill, 3xHS4, 1xloose weave uni. &amp; slow setting epoxy.</p>




        <h2 id="a6">&sect;6. Building up the lip</h2>

        <p>The goal here is to build up the lip to a uniform thickness of about 4mm. This isn't as easy as it sounds as the sanding process creates uneveness. The starting point is a thin lip (about 1mm). Before I start building up the lip I need to cut back the lip to a height of about 1.5&quot; if it's higher than that the round sanding block won't fit. I used to do this with a cut off wheel but I can now do it on the band saw.</p>

        <p>I have tried the following methods of building up the lip:</p>

        <h3>&sect;6.1 Built up with layers of carbon</h3>
        <p>Initially I built up the lip with layers of carbon and then cut a grove with
        a hacksaw into the lip for the hinge tube. The advantage of this method is that the lips have a uniform thickness and the because the carbon is hard it takes a while to sand a thin spot. The disadvantages are the difficulty in cutting the channel, the risk of cutting right through the lip and the difficulty in sanding the carbon.</p>


        <h3>&sect;6.2 Built up with epoxy</h3>
        <p>This approach involves gluing the hinge tube onto the lip and building around this with epoxy. The only advantage of this method is not having to cut a groove for the tube. The disadvantages is that it's very difficult getting the profiles equal and I don't think I ever did quite get the two lips the same size.</p>

        <h3>&sect;6.3 Built up with foam and epoxy</h3>
        <p>This method uses a foam core for the lip. The idea was that that foam would be easy to sand. In this method we don't want the foam going the full width of the bag otherwise you would see it in the cross section so I leave a gap at the far edge of the lip, the ends and around the clip cut out and fill with epoxy. Another reason for adding epoxy at the ends was that it would act as a guide for the sanding block so that the foam wouldn't be easily sanded away. I did, however find that it was difficult to get an uniform thickness of epoxy so instead I used pre-made curved molded epoxy pieces which I glue on all four corners.</p>

        <p>MC2 is 22.7cm long, so the length of the foam will be 21.7cm (allowing for 5mm of epoxy on each end). The inner edge of hinge tube is 18mm from the inner shell so I have glued on the non-hinge side a 1.2mm carbon rod at that depth so I have something I can align the foam with. Because the foam (thin though it is) won't bend well around the lip, I cut the foam into strips roughly 4mm wide, glue them down with epoxy and hold them in place with masking tape. On MC6 I forgot that I may want to put a curve on the corners of the lip and because I only gave myself 5mm of epoxy on each end I am limited to a radius of about 3mm on MC6.</p>

        <p>When it comes to finally cutting the shell down to size I won't know where the foam finishes at the ends or the area around the clip, therefore I marked on the shell where the foam stops.</p>

        <p>After the foam and epoxy ends went down the process was to sand smooth, check the thickness at three points at each of the four corners and add more epoxy if needed, repeating the process until I was happy. I eventually ended up with an uniform thickness of between 2.8 and 3.0mm. I am hoping this is close enough. Now will this lip thickness be enough for the clip?</p>

        <p>The advantages of this method are that it is quick to build up the lips thickness, easy to sand and reduced weight. The disadvantages are that the epoxy end pieces sand down quickly so it's easy to find your self with an uniform thickness.</p>


        <h3>&sect;6.4 Built up with foam and carbon</h3>
        <p>The method is based on the previous foam method, the only difference being that the moulded parts are now made of carbon which I am hoping will be more resilient to sanding. I may put one of these moulded parts mid-way along the lip. I plan to try this out on MC7.</p>

        <p>The length of the bottom panel is about 22 cm so I will place the carbon moulded parts such that they span no more than 24 cm which gives an extra 1 cm on the ends. I remade the moulded parts by first adding 6 layers of carbon allowing this to set within the tube and then adding thick black epoxy followed by the inner tube, the reason for this was because it was difficult to judge how many layers of carbon would be "enough" without distorting the cross-section. This way just the outside area is carbon and resilient to sanding. Sizes of these pieces are 2.5cm long and ? cm wide for the hinge side and ? cm wide for the other side. I also have small carbon pieces for the outer side of the hinge tube. These are about 4mm wide.</p>

        <p>I added the foam strips to the hinge side first. The first piece goes on the outerside of the hinge tube and this runs the full length. This was set at about 4mm away from the hinge tube, maybe I should have given myself a little more space. This will eventually be cut off but creates a boxed in area on the outside of the hinge that I can fill with epoxy. The next pieces are on the inner side of the hinge tube. On each side I add two pieces of foam which are about 6mm wide in total and 5.5cm long, followed by a full length piece of foam. This gives me another boxed area next to the hinge tube which I will fill with epoxy. The rest of the lip is filled with full length foam strips. The non hinge tube starts with a full length strip of which is set at about 1cm from where the hinge tube would be if this was the hinge side. This is used to create another boxed section. I leave a gap of about 1cm and finish off with full length strips. When all the epoxy is set I run a bead of epoxy along where the foam meets the flat section of the panel.</p>
         
        <p>I was hoping for a uniform thickness of the carbon pieces but didn't achieve this and have a difference of 3 mm to 3.25mm for the hinge side parts and 3.4 to 3.6 and 3.3 to 3.5mm. I may try and sand down the large pieces to get them closer. I will aim to get them all between 3 mm and 3.25 mm. All pieces are now within 0.25mm of each other.</p>

        <p>For my MC8 (kevlar) I forgot to sand the carbon pieces to a uniform thickness so I did this whilst they were attached to the lip. I measured the inner and out thicknesses and sanded them so they were all 0.1mm of 4mm. </p>

        <p>The next stage is to fill the cavities with black epoxy. I under filled them so I wouldn't have too much to sand away.</p>

        <p>With the moulded parts of an uniform thickness, with my square metal bar I go over the lip contour and sanded away any high areas of foam/epoxy.</p>

        <p>It occured to me that if this process of moulding the lip using the acrylic tube and closing panel, I don't need the sanding resilient moulded parts and can use pure epoxy moulded parts, certainly a lot easier.</p>


        <h2 id="a7">&sect;7. Closing panel</h2>

        <h3>&sect;7.1 The mould</h3>
        <p>The mould is made using two acrylic tubes with an outside radius of 1.5" and length of 13".</p>

        <p>The main panel mould has been cut with a 2mm sagitta, this means that where the main panel touches, the tangent is vertical which means that for a closing panel to fit, the mould has to be extend to it's full radius. Because we want the mould to create a closing panel with a flat bottom section, rather that sand it down (which is the wrong thing to do), we must make the mould with the acrylic tubes separated by a set amount. The set amount is difficult to judge as when the closing panel is formed the flat section is the sum of the tube separation distance and the thickness of the closing panel. For MC7 I am separating the tubes by about 1.6mm. I measured the final distance of the formed  piece and I get a width between 3.5 and 4.0mm so I will settle on the average of 3.75mm. This distance becomes the apex width which I will call &quot;aw&quot;.</p>

        <p>I also have to take into account the fact that the formed piece will extend the depth by it's width of about 1mm. Because the mold has a radius of 3/4&quot; (19.1mm) I sanded the ridge down to 18mm.</p>

        <h3>&sect;7.2 Layup</h3>

        <p>As long as the panel is at least 4 layers thick, it doesn't matter what
        thickness it is, though it may be nicer to have it thicker to make it less likely to scratch you. Any less than 4 and it's too flexible and the corners are too sharp. </p>

        <p>MC5 used 5 layers of carbon, 1 twill and 4 plain. For MC6 (6 layers, 1 twill &amp; 5 plain) I coated the mould with epoxy and layed each layer separately (3.75" x 12", mould B), rolling as I went along. Finished piece came out fine. </p>

        <h3>&sect;7.3 Finishing</h3>

        <p>The underside has a thin coat of epoxy applied with a razor blade to ensure a smooth surface with the minimal of resin and then sanded to a matt finish. Once that is done I built up the bottom ridge against glass to obtain a flat bottom.</p>

        <h3>&sect;7.4 Cutting</h3>

        <p>In MC5 I cut the closing panel up into it's three parts (one of which will
        be used in the clip) on the Nobex miter saw, making the cuts at 75 degrees.
        It's not exactly the same as MC2 but close. MC2 was probably cut at an angle of
        78 degrees. The Nobex gave great cuts. Give yourself about 11&quot; of good
        panel to play with so if you need to re-cut angles you can.</p>

        <p>When you eventually come to gluing the closing panels, if there are very
        slight gaps (on the hinge side), then these can be filled by adding a small bit
        of black epoxy and sanding to fit. This would be on the hinge side so you won't
        see it.</p>



        <h2 id="a8">&sect;8 Final lip finish</h2>

        <p>I now have the lip built up to a reasonable thickness but, however well I sand the lip (see &sect;6.4), I never get a perfect fit between lip and closing panel. This section hopefully resolves that.</p>

        <h3>&sect;8.1 Moulding the lip against acrylic tubes</h3>
        <p>Because it's so hard to get a uniform thickness I decided on adding liberal helpings of black epoxy to each lip (one at a time) and clamping over a 1.5&quot; diameter acrylic tube. This gave me a very pleasing smooth and uniform thickness, however, for MC7 &amp; MC8 when I put the bag together there were small gaps on either side between the lower and inner section of the lip and the closing panel. </p>

        <h3>&sect;8.2 Moulding the lip against the closing panel</h3>
        <p>I didn't want to go through all the rigmarole of adding resin and sanding back which takes forever, so I sat down and thought about it. I decided that a good solution would be to mould against the actual closing panel. I had thought of this before but always thought it would be to hard and messey, anyway desparate times calls for desparate measures. Rather than wax up the closing panel to prevent the epoxy from sticking I found a thick arcylic film (0.25mm, which is the approximate thickness of the twill) and using photo adhesive I attached a strip of it to one side of the closing panel. I then covered the lower area of the lip with epoxy and clamped the closing panel on top, I doesn't seem to matter where it gets clamped as long as it's parallel to the lip. I did this on both sides, one side at a time and now the closing panel fits perfectly. I may have to build up the side ends of the bottom panel, but hopefully after I do that I will have a snug fit.</p>

        <p>Note, when using black epoxy try and get it as black as possible as you can see colour variations at the edges of the lip.</p>

        <h3>&sect;8.3 Final twill layer</h3>
        <p>Before I add the final layer of twill there a few things I need to to, sand down the uni carbon to a depth of 9cm from the start of the lip, otherwise the small undulations caused by the binding threads show through into the twill. Next I need to fill the shallow gap caused by the uni did not covering the whole of the bag panel and lastly I will need to mark out where the hinge cut out will b -why?.</p>

        <p>I can now add the final layer of twill. I recoat the shell with release wax as I will be gluing close to the edge of the lip. The layer of twill will start at 9.5 cm for MC7 (and onwards) from the center (each piece of twill was 11cm x 24 cm). Once the final layer of twill is on I brush it vigoursly with my small wire brush, this clear out all the small voids. Once dry I coat it with a film of epoxy, scrapping off the excess with a razor. I sand and recoat with epoxy if necessary. I also need to add some epoxy where the twill stops so I have a smooth transistion from twill to uni. On previous bags I sanded this back to raw carbon which takes for ages, so now if it's smooth and perfect under water I'll be happy.</p>



        <h2>&sect;9 Cutting panel to roughly the correct size</h2>

        <p>I can now cut the bag down to a width of 24cm and the lips to a height of about 22mm.</p>

        <p>Once I have applied the outer layer of carbon to the lip I can get the
        width of the two lips exactly the same by using a sanding jig I made. The depth
        of this jig may change with the new narrower lip, but I will use some form of
        the jig. On MC5 I cut the back the lip to withing 3mm of the hinge pin. Cutting
        close to the hinge tube is delicate and I can't remember how I did it. I may
        have used a rough wood file to get it close before sanding or I may having used
        the grinding disk with a wooden guide. I can now cut the lip back to within 1 mm accuracy on the diamond band saw.</p>

        <p>On MC7 I had already cut the lip back on the and aw to about 21mm and using my sanding jig I sanded it back to 20mm.</p>

        <p>I have also thought of putting various curves in the lips corners, from a simple quarter cicrle to a curve then extends all the way to the center of the lip. I haven't tried this yet but I do think this is worth trying on a bag sometime. I will at least put a slight curve at each end of the lip so it isn't sharp.</p>

        <p class="needed">Before I can put everything together and check for fit I need to trim the side sections of the bottom panel. For MC6 before I added the twill the bottom panel ends were undersized. I adding more epoxy to the sides of the bottom panel and marked the end profile using my latest jig and then orientating the lines out at the top by 1.5mm so it would start over-sized. I then sanded very slowing checking the fit of the whole bag each time. I would sand about 10 strokes at a time. I eventually got to the original cross-section markings and with a few additional sanding strokes and cutting the height down to 119mm &amp; 118.5mm I got the fully assembled bag to fit snugly together. What a relief. I am now hoping that MC8 (kevlar) will fit well also.</p> 











        <h2 id="a9">&sect;9. Making the side brackets</h2>

        <h3>&sect;9.1 The mould</h3>
        <p>The side bracket is made between male and female moulds and For MC7 I am going to make a new large mould that can make two side panels at one time For this mould the male is one piece and the female two piece. I tried a single female mould but I got bubbles trapped in it.</p>

        <p>I have always been getting small voids at the right angle when using the male and female mould system. I filled them but it was always difficult to get a nice finish in that area afterwards. For MC6 I just used just the male mould and after removing it from the mould I coated the outside surface
        with epoxy and  sanded smooth.  Sanding the epoxy smooth proved too hard so I am going back to using two moulds. I changed the female mould so it has a tighter fit and now the panels are coming out without any voids at the corners. </p>

        <h3>&sect;9.2 Layup</h3>
        <p>For MC6 and onwards I am using 5 layers 2 x twill, 1 x plain and 2 of uni. I roll each layer of carbon as I put it down. When moulding this piece, tilt the mould so that air bubble don't get trapped and use a slow setting epoxy. For MC7, 2 x twill and 3 x plain as I couldn't be bothered to cut up the uni. Size, 23 x 39cm.</p>

        <p>For MC8 I used 2 x twill, and 3 x plain as I couldn't be bothered to cut the uni. Size for the double layout was 23cm x 39cm.</p>



        <h2 id="a10">&sect;10. Cutting out the side brackets and bottom inserts</h2>

        <h3>&sect;10.1 Side panels</h3>

        <h4>&sect;10.1.1 Marking out</h4>
        <p>For the end panels I need to get the two end sections the same size and on the same horizontal plane. For MC6 I used a large right angle draughtmans square to draw a silver line across the panels near an edge. I then extended this around to the sides. I use this line to line up the paper template. <a href="./side_section_mc8.pdf">Template for MC7 & 8</a>.</p>

        <p>Cut out paper templates for panels, align the side and arms to the line I drew and attach with masking tape. Mark around them with a silver sharpie and if I now cut to the outside of this I have 2mm of lee way.</p> 

        <h4>&sect;10.1.2 Cutting</h4>
        <p>I no longer use the diamond cut off wheel as it is difficult to control, instead I use a diamond burr which although slower gives me more control and a closer cut. I then file to the line with the belt sander. Bits I couldn't get to I file by hand. To cut out the inserts I drilled a single hole in each of them and then used the diamond grinding bits to cut the section out. I then went round the holes again to tidy them up. Using these diamond tools speeds everything up.</p>

        <p>It's important that certain measurements match between the two side panels. Some measurements aren't so important such as the size of the cut outs or the width at the middle. The measurements that need to match are:</p>

        <ul><li>sides are vertical - when the panel is placed on a flat surface, the sides are perpendicular to the surface, sand the bottom of the arms to achieve this</li>
        <li>Arm forms a right angle</li>
        <li>Depth that the arm extends below - clamp a ruler across the bottom of the main section and sand back to the ruler</li>
        <li>Arm profiles - to get the arm profiles the same I used a cardboard template which I lined up inside and marked around with silver sharpie.</li>
        <li>Width at widest part</li>
        </ul>

        <p> All other measurements were made with my calipers and I achieved all sets of measurements to within 0.5 mm of each other.</p>


        <h3>&sect;10.2 Bottom panel</h3>

        <h4>&sect;10.2.1 Sides</h4>
        <p>I now have an acrylic jig which allows me to align the apexes. The jigs ends are labelled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and the first thing I do is to find out which way the bottom panel fits best (the bottom panel is maybe 0.5 mm wider at one end) and once deteremined I mark the ends of the panel &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. The next step is to put a piece of masking tape at the bottom of each side and make a mark 1/4&quot; either side of where the vertical center line will roughly be. The jig has this line scribed into it and within a few attempts I can get a pen mark on the tape to line up with the scribed line. This is the line I use to line up the template for cutting out the bottom. I then use an angle to scribe a vertical line on the ends. Once done I put the panel back in the jig, clamp it in and mark around the acrylic end sections with a silver sharpie. In MC7 I found that cutting to this line will give me a slightly oversized section which is perfect.</p>


        <h4>&sect;10.2.1 Bottom area</h4>

        <p>I line up the paper template using the vertical line I scribed earlier, tape it down in a few places and mark around it with a silver sharpie. Templates: <a href="./sbottom_mc8.pdf">MC8 (10.9cm wide)</a>,&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="./sbottom_mc8_v2.pdf">MC8 (10.7cm wide)</a>.</p>

        <h4>&sect;10.3 Cutting the panels</h4>

        <p>I am now cutting the panels out with a cyclindrical sintered diamond burr  bit, it takes longewr than the cut off wheel, but gives me better control.</p>

        <p>After I cut the bottom panel out I have to add small amounts of epoxy at it's widest point to get a nice curve. For MC8b I found that cutting back another 0.5 to 1mm past the section given by the acrylic jig gives a good fit of the closing panel.</p>

        <h4>&sect;10.4 Clamping system</h4>

        <p>The clamping system requires that I drill a hole in the ends of the bottom section center, 17mm from the bottom for the &quot;L&quot; shaped arms and 5mm for the &quot;D&quot; shaped arms. Start with a 1/4&quot; drill bit and then file to a square hole. When finished I fill the holes up with epoxy.</p>



        <h2 id="a11">&sect;11 Coating and polishing the side sections</h2>

        <p>Same as &sect;16 below. I coat the side panels earlier because before I fit them into the recess (see following sections) I want to add the ultrasuede. I don't coat the bottom panel just yet as I still need to add the stops onto it and don't want to get any glue on the finished surface.</p>





        <h2 id="a12">&sect;12 Ultrasuede arms</h2>
        <p>The bottom arm were covered to a depth of an inch (using one continuous
        strip) of black ultrasuede, this was so that the carbon didn't rub against
        carbon and make a scraping noise. I do this after the side panels have been coated.</p>

        <p>E6000 is used to bond the ultrasuede which I smeared on with a small strip of plastic. I clamped them in place for about an hour which flattened then nicely. After the glue was set I trimmed the excess off with a razor. For MC7 I cut the strip to 2&quot; long, though for MC8 I will cut them to a length of 2.5&quot;.</p>






        <h2 id="a13">&sect;13. Fitting the main, closing and bottom panels together</h2>

        <p>This is the most important and difficult part of the bag. Making sure that 3 components fit together snugly. The section will eventually be merged into other sections. The 3 components must fit together as follows:</p>

        <ol><li>The point where the curvature of the lip starts on the panel must, when folded around the bottom section, meet the top of the inner panel</li>
        <li>The closing panels must fit snugly over the two lips</li>
        <li>The bottom of the closing panel must touch the top of the bottom insert and be of the same apex width (&quot;aw&quot;) as the top of the bottom insert</li>
        </ol>

        <p>All of the above must be true to get the bag to close correctly. Previously I did this by an iterative process, sanding this piece, adding epoxy to another etc. which took an extremely long and frustrating time. I am now trying to take better measurements so that the pieces fit together without too much adjusting. I look at each of the necessary fittings.</p>

        <h3>&sect;13.1 Panel and bottom section fit</h3>

        <p>These measurements are aimed towards making the outer mould as the accuracy of this part is most important.</p>

        <p>The plan now is to match the outer perimeter of the bottom section to the length of the panel (stopping when the lip curve begins). For MC6 I found that a bottom section with an outer radius of 1&quot; proved a good fit for a panel length of 13.25&quot;. I have decided on a top angle of 60&deg; and have come up with a formula that caluclates the perimeter of the cross section with curvature of radius &quot;r&quot;. The formula is:</p>

        <div class="equ">p = 2r(tan75&deg; + (2/3)&pi; + 1)  =&gt; 13.6528r</div>
        <div class="equ"> or ph = r6.8264 for half the perimeter</div>

        <p>The current mould produces a panel length of around 13.375&quot; (339.725 mm) and this includes the extra build up on the lip, though every time I measure it it's something different. I may have to play around with values between 337mm and 339.725mm. Using the formula above, the radius that gives us a perimeter of 13.375&quot; is 13.375/13.6528 or 0.9795&quot;. My 1&quot; router bit gives a perimeter of 13.6528&quot; which is 0.4&quot; too long however I can fix this by allowing the two circles that make up the radius to overlap - currently they are just touching. </p>


        <h4>&sect;13.1.1 Overlapping circles</h4>
        <p>Overlapping the circles still preserves the 60&deg; angle. The formula for calculating the shift is quite simple, if each circles is moved in by y, then the total perimeter is reduced by:</p>
        <div class="equ"> 2(y + y/sin30&deg;) =&gt; 6y</div>  

        <p>Metric conversions: 
        1" = 25.4mm, 1.0492" = 26.65mm, 13.375&quot; = 339.725mm</p>

        <p>We also need to take into account the panel not stopping at the apex, instead it stops before that to leave a flat apex, currently I am thinking that 3mm would be a good width of the flat apex.</p>

        <p>If we move each circle inwards a distance of y, then the perimeter gets reduced by 6y, thus: </p>
        <div class="equ">p = 13.6528r - 6y</div> 

        <p>A flat apex of &quot;x&quot; reduces the perimeter by:</p>
        <div class="equ">x/Sin30&deg; =&gt; 2x</div>

        <p>Thus reducing the perimeter by 2x to gives an apex of &quot;x&quot; mm</p>

        <div class="equ">p + 2x = 13.6528r - 6y</div> 

        <div class="equ">y = <span class="fracNum">(13.6528r - p - 2x)</span>/<span class="fracDen">6</span></div> 

        <p>Now as p is defined by my mould to be 339.725mm we have:</p>

        <div class="equ">y = <span class="fracNum">(13.6528r - 339.725 - 2x)</span>/<span class="fracDen">6</span></div> 

        <p>Because I have a 1&quot; round-over router bit, this is the radius I will make the moulds out of. Using the same radius for the inner mould will cause the thickness of the bottom panel to be uneven but I can make adjustments for this. See &sect;5.2. Thus we have:</p>

        <div class="equ"> =&gt; y = (25.4 x 13.6528 - 339.725 - 6)/6 </div>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = (346.78 - 345.725)/6 </div>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = 1.056/6 </div>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = 0.176mm </div>  

        <p>In conclusion if I make the outer bottom mould with a radius of 1&quot;, there centers separated by 4x25.4 - 2x0.176 = 101.6 - 0.352 = 101.25mm, then the current panel should wrap around this and end with a 3mm flat apex. I will need to double check this by cutting a section out of mdf.</p>

        <p>I made a mould out of mdf and the carbon shell is too short for y=0.176mm, ie the mdf if too wide. I will try smaller perimeter values of 338mm and 337mm.</p>

        <p>For p = 340mm:</p>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = (346.78 - 340 - 6)/6 </div>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = 0.13mm </div>  

        <p>For p = 339mm:</p>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = (346.78 - 339 - 6)/6 </div>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = 0.3mm </div>  

        <p>For p = 338mm:</p>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = (346.78 - 338 - 6)/6 </div>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = 0.46mm </div>  

        <p>For p = 337mm:</p>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = (346.78 - 337 - 6)/6 </div>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = 0.63mm </div>  

        <p>For p = 336mm:</p>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = (346.78 - 336 - 6)/6 </div>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = 0.8mm </div>  

        <p>For p = 335mm:</p>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = (346.78 - 335 - 6)/6 </div>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = 0.96mm </div>  

        <p>For p = 334mm:</p>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = (346.78 - 334 - 6)/6 </div>
        <div class="equ">=&gt; y = 1.1mm </div>  

        <p>For MC7 I made the mistake of using a p value of around 335mm. How I came to this was that I cut out mdf templates using various values of &quot;p&quot; and tried them on the MC6 panel - I suspect that the lip on MC6 was thinner which resulted in a lower value of &quot;p&quot;. What I will need to do now if find a mdf template that fits the MC7 panels and build up the bottom panel to match it. V7 (y=0.46mm) is the closest match so I will build up the bottom panel to match this. Why can't this be easy? </p>

        <p>I made a new acrylic jig (y=0.5mm, angle = 29&deg;) and recut the end panel. I also cut them to a height of 118.5mm. I seem to have been lucky and everything seems to fit together pretty well. I used an old closing panel (made with mould B) and sometime I will have to work out how this was made, ie. how far apart were the acrylic tubes and what height was it cut down to.</p>



        <h3>&sect;13.2 The closing panels sits snugly over both lips</h3>

        <p>However well I finish the lip in section 6 I never get a perfect fit between lip and closing panel. This section hopefully resolves that. do the lips need to be shaped and orientated for the closing panel to fit?</p>

        <p>For MC7 the closing panels does not fit over the build up lip. What I plan to do is to build up with epoxy packed up with a section of acrylic tube whose curvature matches that of the closing panel. I'm not sure I will end up with the correct lip cross section, but it's worth trying. I tried this and I did get a nice contour which matched the acrylic tuibe, however when I put the bag together there were small gaps on either side between the lower and inner section of the lip and the closing panel. </p>

        <p>I didn't want to go through all the rigmarole of adding resin and sanding back which takes forever, so I sat down and thought about it. I decided that a good solution would be to mould against the actual closing panel. I had thought of this before but always thought it would be too hard and messey, anyway desparate times calls for desparate measures. Rather than wax up the closing panel to prevent the epoxy from sticking I found a thick arcylic film (0.25mm) and using photo adhesive I attached a strip of it to one side of the closing panel. I then cover the lover area of the lip with epoxy and clamped the closing panel on top, I don't think it matters where it gets clamped as long as it's parallel to the lip. I did this on both sides, one side at a time and now the closing panel fits perfectly. I may have to build up the side ends of the bottom panel, but hopefully after I do that I will have a snug fit.</p>


        <h3>&sect;13.3 Closing panel touches the bottom panel and be of the same width as the top of the bottom insert</h3>

        <p>The most important part of fitting the bag together is making sure that the
        closing panel fits snugly, especially before I glue anything.</p>

        <p>What I need to pay attention when making the closing panel is the sagitta used when making the main panel mold. The sagitta is important because in part it determines the apex angle. I say in part as it also depends upon how much the closing panel has it's height reduced. I did a few calculations with different sagitta's (based on a 9/16&quot; or 14.3mm radius) and these are the angles I got:</p>

        <div class="equ">s = 1.5mm =&gt; &#952; = 26.5&deg;</div>
        <div class="equ">s = 1.8mm =&gt; &#952; = 29&deg;</div>
        <div class="equ">s = 1.9mm =&gt; &#952; = 30&deg;</div>
        <div class="equ">s = 2mm =&gt; &#952; = 30.67&deg;</div>
        <div class="equ">s = 2.1mm =&gt; &#952; = 31.4&deg;</div>
        <div class="equ">s = 2.3mm =&gt; &#952; = 32.9&deg;</div>
        <div class="equ">s = 2.5mm =&gt; &#952; = 34.4&deg;</div>

        <div class="equ">s = r(1-Cos&#952;) &amp; &#952; = Cos<sup style="font-size:x-small">-1</sup>((r-s)r)</div>

        <p>The variation of angle with sagitta doesn't sound much, but it makes a big difference, remember if I'm out by 2&deg; then that's only on one side and I end up being out by 4&deg; in total. I tried to get a sagitta of 2mm, but I can't tell how close I was and I could be out by 0.5mm either way. What can I do? I can either try and remake the mold but what guarantee do I have that I can make it anymore accurate or I am going to try and work around an unknown sagitta value?</p>

        <p>The mdf templates I made for MC7 are set at 60&deg; and the shell does seem to fit around it fine, so now I am wondering whether I can make a closing panels that fits this. Wrapping the shell around the template and looking at the angle of the lip, it's clear that the tangent isn't perpendicular (which was my hope when I introduced the sagitta) which indicates that my sagitta was &gt; 1.9mm. What I can do is to make a new closing panel to fit the current lips. Currently all I know is that the closing panel should have a flat bottom of 3mm and that it's tangent isn't perpendicular. What measurements do I need to create such a closing panel? It maybe that I first make the bag and then figure out what closing panel will suit it.</p>

        <p>For MC7 I cut the bottom panel apexs at a height of 118.5mm which gives a good fit between the lips and the bottom panel. I may have to increase the depth of the closing panel by about 0.5mm.</p>

        <h3>&sect;13.4 Fitting the side panels</h3>

        <p>At this point with the bottom panel, held in with the clamping system, their should be no gaps when the bag is closed and the closing panel is in place. The next thing to do is to cut away the end panels so I can position the side panels. I will need to work out where the top of the side panels will start and how deep to file away.</p>

        <h3>&sect;13.5 Lined end panels</h3>

        <p>The inside of the end panel will be lined with ultrasuede framed with a thin band of carbon (approx 1cm wide and 1mm thick). The frame hides the edges of the ultrasuede.</p>

        <p>What I am not sure of is whether to glue the frames and ultrasuede to the end panels or to make up the framed ultrasuede on a separate piece of carbon and stick the whole piece on in one go?</p>





        <h2 id="a14">&sect;14. Bottom panel stops</h2>

        <p>Once I have the bottom panel and the closing panel fitting I can add
        the bag stops. These should be added before coating the bottom panel in case glue gets on the finished item. The stops are now moulded using a urethane mould. The current one is a little too deep so I need to either partially fill it or to use the circular diamond disks at the Crucible to sand them down. I sanded the first set by hand and it's hard work. I am also unsure what the ideal thickness should be. Should I glue them on first and then sand or sand them first? For MC7 I shall try and sand them to the correct thickness first.</p>

        <p>The thickness of the stops needs to at least the same thickness of the
        ultrasuede side panel arms, which is about 3.6mm. I have currently sanded the stops to about 4mm.</p>

        <p>Before I can add them the side panel must be accurately cut and a line drawn across the end panels at a height of 25mm (MC7 &amp; 8). It's probably a good idea at this stage to have added the ultrasuede to the side panel arms so I judge the necessary thickness of the stops. The first two to add are the bottom triangular stops. </p>

        <p>The bottom stops are positioned such that the upper most point is at a height equal to the radius of the bottom panel. For MC2 this was 23mm and for MC7 &amp; 8 this is 25mm, this is the widest point of the bag.  The chord of the bottom stops must be perpendicular to the edge of the side panels and can be determined by bottom arm of the side panel.</p>

        <p>When gluing on to the end panel, use a set square to make sure they are glued accurately. Once glued I sand back the overlapping curved edge flush. It is very <span class="crucial">important</span> that the bottom stops are perpendicular, to a <span class="crucial">high accuracy</span>, to the sloping sides of the bottom panel. If they are perpendicular then the bottom arms fit well against it and by laying a rulers end along the bottom stop I can accurately mark sanding lines parallel to the sloping edge.</p>

        <p>On MC7 I tried gluing them on with thin cyano but this was a bit of a disaster as positioing has to be spot on first time and the thin cyano ran all over the finsished surface. Next time use epoxy and an easy way to clamp the pieces whilst the epoxy sets.</p>

        <p>I need to standardise the size as the the bottom moulded stops were only just big enough and the top stops were too big.</p>



        <h2 id="a15">&sect;15. Recessing the side panels</h2>

        <p>Now having got the end stops installed, place the side panels against them,
        this will tell me how far up the recess has to go. Even though the side panel is about 1mm in depth I may have to cut the recess deeper as the AllBrite forms a gusset in the corner.</p>

        <p>I place a "square" strip of acrylic along the bottom stops, this gives me an edge parallel to the sloping edge which I can mark off with silver sharpie to give me a line to sand to. I need to initially get the recess deep enough so that the side panels are flush.</p>

        <p>Once they are flush I need to make sure that the bag closes correctly, for which I need to round off the bottom corners of the side panel ends. What I found was that cutting the recess out and inserting the side panels changes the profile slightly and I noticed gaps along the sloping sides and play in the side panels. This is fine though as when I add the ultrasude frame I can bring it out a bit and fill the gap with epoxy.</p>



        <h2 id="a16">&sect;16. Top panel stops</h2>

        <p>I keep changing my mind about when to glue these stops in. If I glue them in too early I run the risk of having to sand them back (so the end panels fit) and if I glue them in too late I run the risk of spoiling the finished AwlBrite. I have now decided to spilt the upper top stop into two pieces. This will leave me with the bottom stops, two middle tops and a top stop. For MC8 I only have one middle stop. The top stop will be an isosceles triangle made of epoxy and will be easy to shape. </p>

        <p>The top stops can be added once the recesses have been cut and sanded back with the side panels in place to make sure the edge remains straight and more importantly that the bag closes well. To sand the top flat section of the end panels I rest the bottom panel on it's side againt an acrylic block and then sand it with another vertical block, that way I know that the points get sanded parallel to the bottom (I need to build a jig to this as the above method doesn't give me a perfectly flat top).</p>

        <p>The middle section will be made of core foam as it isn't visible, will reduce the weight by a few grams and is only used to help bond the end panel on. Two pieces of foam (3mm & 2mm thickness) are first epoxied together. With the side panel in place I make a paper templat and rough cut the foam. I wet sand them for a slightly undersized fit. Foam is epoxied to the ends and then sanded flush.</p>

        <p>Like the bottom stops it would be nice if I could make them of the correct thickness to begin with as although sanding on the diamond disk is quite straight forward it does take time. Before I make a new mould I need to standardise on the thickness. I am now under-filling the mold which means sanding them down to the desired 4mm isn't too hard and can be done at home.</p>

        <p>Once the bottom and top stops are glued in I need to make sure they are all level. I place a thick piece of acrylic on the top and swing it over the bottom stops, looking for low or high points iin the stops. If they are really small ie. less than 0.5mm I will attempt to sand them flat. If they are greater than that I will coat the three stops with black epoxy and weight them down against glass (coated with spray realease). This leaves me with a nice flush end. It's a good idea to trim the excess resin of with a razor blade before it sets hard.</p>

        <p>The bag now closes well with the tops installed and it is now time to add the ultrasuede frame.</p>
         
         
         
        <h2 id="a17">&sect;17. Ultrasuede Frame</h2>

        <p>This my last chace to get the bag to close well. At every stage before this, &sect;13.4, &sect;15 &amp; &sect;16 I try to get the bag to close well, however things never work out perfectly.</p>
         
        <p>I estimated that I would need strips about 8mm wide, in fact it would have been better if I cut them to 9mm and also made them at least 12cm long. When cutting them out on the bandsaw I set the guide 20cm (need to measure the extra bit the ruler adds) from the right edge and the width came out at 9.5 mm which is fine.</p>

        <p>It was a bit of a pain getting them to meet as the top cleanly and this invloved sanding them multiple times, hence the extra length is helpful. I now have a cardboard template set at 30&deg; which I can use to mark off the angle. Make sure that the edges of the carbon strips are sanded flat, I didn't do this on MC7 and I can see a slight unevenness in the edge. You probably won't notice this but it may make fitting the ultrasuede harder.</p>

        <p>Once the strips fit well I use multiple clamp along the whole length and use a medium vicosity cyanno, low vicosity runs everywhere. I clamp both of them in place and makle sure everything looks fine, I then remove one and glue the other one. Once that has set I glue the remaining one. Be careful of the cyanno running. Once glued I then need to sand the recess into these and make sure the bag closes well. I undersand them cautiously as I want the bag to close perfectly will a miniumum play in the side panels.</p>

        <p>Once the bag closes well if the carbon frame are proud I can run a small bead of black epoxy along them and sand back. I also did a final sand on the flat tops and the bag now closes well and the closing panel is snug.</p>

        <p>Before I coat will Awlbrite I need to sand down any loose Alwbrite and remove and silver sharpie marks.</p>







        <h2 id="a18">&sect;18 Coating and polishing the bottom section</h2>

        <h3>&sect;18.1 Coating</h3>
        <p>Like all moulded parts I end up with tiny voids. On MC6 I did paint surface with black paint to fill the few remaining voids, but sanding back is hard work and after I sanded it off I could still see the voids, saying that now the pieces are all polished I can see very small dark specs which could be where the paint did fill the voids. In future just coat with AwlBrite until they are filled. Using the roller during application of the carbon really helps reduce the voids.</p>

        <p>For MC6 I applied 4 thin layers of AwlBrite. In future after I have applied it I should go over it again with a fresh foam pad to remove any runs which can form on the curved or vertical surfaces. Applying thin coats reduces runs and the key to a thin coat is to not over load the pad. Before the 4th coat I sanded down any dust spots with 1000 grit (though next time try 2500 grit first and just concentrate on the dust specs). After the 4th coat new dust specs were still visible even though I had cleaned up and steamed the bathroom prior to this coat.</p>

        <h3>&sect;18.2 Polishing</h3>
        <p>Because I got the dust specs I decided to see how well hand polishing works. First I went over the surface with 1000 grit (though next time try 2500 grit first) followed by heavy, intermediate, fine and then NuWax. The results are pretty good, not as glossy as the untreated surface but the dust specs are significantly reduced and I think this will be fine as the final surface.</p>

        <p>I recently got a set of 3M micron sandpaper which goes from 400 to 8,000 grit. I went over the oabove pieces starting with the 400 and working up to the 8,000. After I had finished I ended up with a surface half way between the matt and the gloss. I then tried using small buffing wheels and my polishing compounds. My first try was with the small muslim pads, these did improve the surface gloss but it wasn't as glossy as the unsanded AwlBrite. I put this down to the muslim being too coarse. I then tried a little mop head but that was worse and the surface was no better than the 8,000 grit. Next I tried some soft leather pads, but again these gave a similar result to the muslim. Last I tried some big soft cloth pads (2&quot;) and although they did over power the drill a bit, using No. 1 &amp; 2 compounds I got it very close to the natural Awlbrite which I am very happy with.</p>
         
        <h3>&sect;17.3 Matt finish</h3>
        <p>For MC5 I tried a matt carbon finish. It was coated with AllBrite to fill up any blemishes and then sanded back to raw carbon. I thought that the matt finish may stand up to scratches better than the gloss, however after looking at the finished results I thought that the gloss surface was more impressive.</p>



        <h2 id="a19">&sect;19 Middle stops</h2>

        <p>I add the middle sections when I have added the ultrasuede framing and finished with the internal Awlbrite coating.</p>

        <p>The middle section will be made of core foam as it isn't visible, will reduce the weight by a few grams and is only used to help bond the end panel on.  Fotr MC7 and earlier this was two pieces. For MC8 it is a single piece. Two pieces of foam (3mm & 2mm thickness) are first epoxied together. With the side panel in place I make a paper template, rough cut the foam and wet sand for a slightly undersized fit. Foam is epoxied to the ends and then sanded flush.</p>


        <h2 id="a20">&sect;20. Panel final cut</h2>

        <p>With the bag assembled and held together with clamps I can mark out on the main panel (silver sharpie) where it needs to be cut. The thickness of the sharpie was about 2mm and I cut to the outer edge of this which should be fine as the end panel will be about 1mm. I marked on the indside and transferred the marks to the masking tapped outside with my calipers.</p>

        <p>For MC7 and probably MC8 I only just gave myself enough length and I had to sand the stops down a shade. Next time add an extra 1-2mm just to be sure I don't cut it too short.</p>


        <h2 id="a21">&sect;21. Clip</h2>

        <p>The clip does not need to be fully functioning before the bottom panel is glued in, though it will make things easier if the cut out is mostly complete.</p>

        <h3>&sect;21.1 Making the clip</h3>

        <p>The clip will use the same layout as the closing panel so that it lies flush with it.</p>

        <p>The clip used to have the closing lip moulded into it, but this meant a trade in of how thick I could make the clip. If I made it thin so the closing lip flexed, then the rest of the clip was too weak. The minimum 4 layers proved too inflexible. I am now making the clip out of two parts. I am using my small clip and lip making mould to make a clip out of 2 layers. I am then cutting it in half and gluing it onto the 5 layers clip (same cross section as the closing panels). This now gives me a rigid clip with a flexible lip.</p>

        <p>The lip runs down the edge of the curved lip and extends maybe 2mm past the end of the lip. Onto the length of this I glue a section of carbon fiber tube which I have sanded on one side to create a narrow slit. After gluing this on I found a bit of play in the clip which I think was due to loose hinge pins. I have have made tighter fitting hinge pins, but I am also thinking of a different hinge pin design (see hinge pin below).</p>

        <p>I need to standardise on the actual clip size. I will use the same dimensions as I did on MC2. The basic shape is a isosceles trapezium with the base lengths being 2.5" and 1.5". For MC5 I cut the closing panel using the Nobex at an angle of 75 degrees, which is close to MC2. I will supply the dimensions for cutting at this angle.</p>

        <p>For MC7 &amp; MC8 I cut the hinge to 1&quot; to 2&quot;, which is too small, it should have been 1.5&quot; to about 2.5&quot;. I will remake them but using carbon/fiber glass for MC8.</p>



        <h3>&sect;21.2 Clip cutout</h3>
        <p>To make sure the clip is centered, make the cutout after I have made the final bandsaw cut of the main shell.</p>

        <p>With the clip cut out of the closing panel, I clamp the center of the clip over the center of the lip and mark around it with my silver pen. Make sure you are marking the lip with the hinge tube. I used the large diamond file to remove the lip and it did a quick job of it. </p>

        <p>For the sides I have cut an acrylic bar at an angle of 75&deg; and glued wet and dry sand paper to the edge. This way I can get a nice slanted edge which is difficult to get with a file. The other end of the acrylic bar I have glued wet and dry sand paper to the wide surface so I can sand the bottom of the cut out flat.</p>

        <p>Note, it may be worth assembling the whole clip before I AwlBrip it is as I'm not sure how well epoxy bonds to it.</p>





        <h2 id="a22">&sect;22. Gluing in the bottom panel</h2>

        <h3>&sect;22.1 Prerequisites</h3>
        <ul><li>Shell polished</li>
        <li>Lips formed and of equal depth on each side</li>
        <li>Hinge tube installed</li>
        <li>Clip slot has been cut</li>
        <li>Bottom and top stops have been added</li>
        <li>The bag closes correctly and the closing panel fits snuggly</li>
        <li>Shell trimmed 5mm oversized on both sides</li>
        <li>Side panels, trimmed and polished</li>
        <li>Ultrasuede friction tabs added using E6000.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the next bag, it may be worth chamfering edges of the side and bottom panels, such that there is an undercut, this will hopefully allow any excess glue to settled.</p>

        <p>Previously I held the bottom panel in place with magnets. The disadvantage of this was that the magnets didn't have enough foce to hold it firmly. In MC5 I improved the clamping by having a steel rod running straight through the bag. This did involve cutting 6mm holes through each end but they will be covered/filled up. The use of this clamping system is very useful as I can now clamp the mould down firmly and securely whilst still being able to close the bag. Again as mentioned above I line the mould up as best I can making sure the lips line up etc etc. and then put a pit of cyanno at both ends. By gluing the center section only I can still open up the bag, the advantage of which is that I can finish one half of it (ie. add the ultrasuede etc.) and be able to get a camera in to photograph the details. It also gives me extra room to work on the placing the utrasuede.</p>

        <p>I did notice a little ripple along the bottom of the bag in MC2, I thought this was beacuse I hadn't clamped the bottom in securely when glueing it, but now I think the curves are introduced where the shell isn't glued to the bottom panel (where the ultrasuede inserts go) and the shell takes on it's own shape. I am not worried about this.</p>

        <p>Tip before applying any cyano to the bag make sure it is dry otherwise you get a white bloom which is difficult to get off. If I let the cyano cure naturally it cures clear.</p>

        <p>I just did a search on Cyanoacrylate and it seems that epoxy might be stronger. I may consider dripping epoxy around the bottom panel, instead of Cyanoacrylate. In MC5 I have glued up one side by applying epoxy to it. You have to be careful to keep the epoxy away from the end panels (I don't want them being glued further up the shell - glue seeps) and I had to be careful removing the excess glue with little bits of cardbaord. I have only epoxied one side so far as I want to keep one side open for photography, but once I have glued up the other side I will go over it with superglue.</p>

        <h3>&sect;22.2 MC7</h3>

        <p>For MC7 I followed what I did in MC5. I  put the clamps on and made sure the bag closed perfectly, I then openned it up and put some epoxy under one side of the bottom bracket (using thin plastic strips) and then clamped the bag closed. This is also handy as it will leave one side open for photographs. </p>

        <p>Once the epoxy is set I glued the bottom section down, using the clamping system for the last time and closed the bag up. I feel the clamp may help get a better and flatter bond.</p>

        <p>I had excess glue which needed to be sanded away so for MC8 try and clean it up before it cures. </p>



        <h2 id="a23">&sect;23. Gluing in the end panel ultrasuede</h2>

        <p>First make a cardboard template that fits in the recess and with this mark out on the back of the ultrasuede. I put masking tape on the bag so I could use a fine tipped pen. I cut slightly oversized and then trimmed back with the ultrasuede sicsors until I got a good fit.</p>

        <p>Cutting this to size is certainly a good thing to do before glueing in the bottom panel, but how and when to glue in the fabric. I need the hole undercovered during the bottom panel glueing which means I can't glue in the fabric, however everything will be so much easier to do if I can glue in the fabric before attaching the bottom section to the main panel. It maybe that I only glue in a portion of it?</p> 

        <p>For MC7 I glued in the bottom panel first and then filled the clamping holes. For one end I smeared the E6000 onto the carbon and for the other end I smeared it on the cloth. I think smearing it on the cloth was the easiest.</p>




        <h2 id="a24">&sect;24. Gluing the side brackets</h2>

        <h3>&sect;24.1 Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>Prerequisites: </p>
        <ul><li>Shell polished</li>
        <li>Lips formed and of equal depth on each side</li>
        <li>Hinge tube installed</li>
        <li>Clip slot has been cut</li>
        <li>Bottom and top stops have been added</li>
        <li>Ultrasuede end panels are complete</li>
        <li>The bag closes correctly and the closing panel fits snuggly</li>
        <li>Shell trimmed 5mm oversized on both sides</li>
        <li>Side panels, trimmed and polished</li>
        <li>Bottom panel glued</li>
        <li>Ultrasuede friction tabs added using E6000.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I held one of the side panels in place with magnets and opened and closed the bag a few times to make sure the bag was closing correctly and that the end of the side panels fitted snuggly in the end panel recess. Once I was happy I drew a line around it with a fine sharpie, remove the side panel and smeared black epoxy over the shell making sure I left at least 1/8&quot; around the edges inorder to stop the glue from oozing out. I  then placed it back using the sharpie lines to position it and then carefully placed the magnets back. It did ooze a bit but I scrapped away the excess glue with a small plastic strip. Make sure the epoxy is very black. Note, it would have been easier to coat the side panel instead of the shell. I clamped the bag closed and set it horizontal. I checked it a few times and removed a little more excess glue. </p>

        <p>When glueing in the side panel I noticed that it extended over the shell where the thickness decreases. I could see that there side panel wasn't lying flat over this section and there was a small gap. Seeing that on MC7 the side panel is only exposed down to about 2&quot; below the initial curve of the bag, I could make the increase in thickness more gradual.</p>

        <p>The magnets made marks on the outer shell so next time tape a plastic sheet over it first.</p>

        <h3>&sect;24.1 Problem with bag</h3>
        <p>Having glued in one side panel I notice a slight ripple in the carbon when the bag is open. The ripple is only present at the ends of the bag. I initially thought that this was caused because the bottom panel for MC7 is the widest it has ever been but it now looks like  I shall study this more but the likely solution will probably be to make it slightly shallower. Shame MC7 didn't work out.</p> 

        <p>The problem is because the upward curve of the bag changes along it's length which is due to the bottom panel tapering toward the center. The carbon naturally wants to be flatten out so near the center where the bottom section is at it's narrowest the curve of the bag is greater. At the ends the bag is pulled in futher by the bottom section, thus reducing the curvature. My best guess is that once the panel if free from being held in by the bottom panel at the ends, it quickly wants to return to he curvature of the remaining shell, hence the discontinuity in the curve. It may be that the side panel is also restricting the curve at the ends, but this will be to a lesser degree as the majority of the carbon beneath the side panels is rigid.</p>

        <p>To fix this in MC8 I am redesigning the ends of the side panels such that their outward motion will be restricted.</p>
         

        <h2 id="a25">&sect;25. Middle panel stops</h2>

        <p>As mentioned earlier the middle stops are now made in two pieces, the top one is foam core, the lower one is epoxy.  I leave these stops until after I have glued in the bottom panel onto the main shell so that I can see how the bag opens and closes.</p>

        <p>Easiest way to get the size is to slide paper under the side panels when the bag is closed, rough cut and then hand sand. Each end will be slightly different so mark each one. It is important that the arms can swing up enough and the lower of the tops stops doesn't prevent this.</p>

        <p>Like the bottom stops it would be nice if I could make them of the correct thickness to begin with as although sanding on the diamond disk is quite straight forward it does take time. Before I make a new mould I need to standardise on the thickness. I could also replace more than half of the upper top stop with foam which is lighter and easier to sand.</p>

        <p>I also need to standardise the size as the the bottom moulded stops were only just big enough and the top stops were too big.</p>


        <h2 id="a26">&sect;26. Hinge pin</h2>
        <p>The current spring loaded pin is made as follows. The pin composes of two pieces, each one 25mm long and is comprised of two pieces, the inner tube which is 25mm x 1mm rod, sanded slightly so it will fit within a 1.8mm x 1mm
        tube. The 1.8mm tube is cut to a length of 16mm and sanded slightly so that it fits within a 3.1mm x 1.8mm tube. The 1.8mm tube is superglued over the inner rod such that 5mm sticks out of one end and 4mm out of the other end. The outer 
        3.1mm tube is about 56mm long. </p>

        <p>On the 4mm end of the 1mm rod I put a spring (0.057" OD x 0.008 WD x 0.375 FL, part number csmw-003). To keep the springs apart I add a 5mm spacing rod which consists of a section of the 1.8mm tube with rod glued inside.</p>

        <p>The carbon fiber rods and tubes come from RCFoam.com and I believe the manufacturer is Galaxys International. I am not sure where I got the 3.1mm x 1.8mm tube, but RCFoam do stock a 3.0 x 2.0mm and a 3.5 x 1.8mm tube which I may try. I found it too fiddling trying to sand the 1.8mm tube to fit nicely into 2.5mm x 1.7mm tube. The 1.8mm tube fits in the 3.1 x 1.8mm tube with very little sanding. I think it will be worth trying the 3.0mm x 2.0mm tube next. Although the difference in diamters is only small and sometimes the same, nothing fits without sanding and with the previous 2.5mm x 1.7mm tube I had to do a lot of sanding of the 1.8mm tube and my eventual fit was a bit loose and I suspect the tube wasn't very round either.</p>

        <p>I am also thinking of simplifying the hinge pin design and at the same time using a thicker hinge pin, maybe 1.5mm. My idea is to have the hinge pin run the whole length of the bag. It would eventually be secured with a small dap of epoxy on each end, which could always be drilled out if I needed to remove the clip. It all depends on whether I have room for a tube to contain the thicker hinge in the thin lip of the next bag.</p>

        <p>MC7 - I will replace the outer 3.1 x 1.8mm tube with a section of polymide tube which reduces the height of the hinge tube assembly and allows it to be installed in a thinner lip.</p>





        <h2 id="a27">&sect;27. Ultrasuede lining</h2>
        <p>I thought about using white ultrasuede for the lining, but I rubbed some carbon fiber slurry on a test piece and I couldn't wash it clean. I am now using black ultrasuede.</p>

        <p>The font that I will use is SF Quartzite. I will use the same size font as Jen originally did, just need to work out what it is.</p>

        <p>Apart from the side panel inserts I used Devcon Contact adhesive which is waterproof. For the bottom inserts I made paper templates then trimmed the ultrasude to fit. It may be easier to fit &amp; cut these pieces before I glue in the bottom panel, or glue them in once I have just "tacked" the bottom in. I put glue on the carbon and spread it around with a small plastic scrapper followed by coating the ultrasuede. I had to carefully place these as the glue is instant. The best I could do was to line up the straight edge and hope for the best. Luckily the bottom inserts went in fine. It may be worth gluing a very thin platic sheet to the back of the ultrasuede so it is easier to handle and line up. The inserts for the side panel were glued with 3M 77 spray adhesive as I was getting sick of the contact adhesive, I only sprayed the ultrasuede and they seemed to stick fine.</p>

        <p>For the large side sections of ultrasuede I first made cardboard templates. Both sides were slightly different so I needed to make two templates. To glue them in place I used magnets to hold it in place, exposing about 4cm at a time to glue. When applying the glue to the Ultrasuede I just applied it straight out of the tube.</p>

        <p>Liz from the crucible recommended using E6000 as it has a slow set, is flexible and allows you to re-position the ultrasuede.</p>


        <h2 id="a27">&sect;27. End panels - flat</h2>
        <p>1 layer of twill<br>
        2 layers of plain</p>



        <h2 id="a28">&sect;28. Putting it all together</h2>
        <p>This is the part I was dreading, when do I glue in the bottom panel? The advantage of having it glued is that it won't move and I don't have to use magnets. The disadvantages are that the bag is harder to work with etc. However,
        it has to be done sometime, but when? I have now glued in the bottom panel, at either end and the middle section. I lined up the lips by eye, made sure the closing panels fit reasonably well (I will have to add black epoxy for a perfect fit) and used magnets at the end and in the middle.</p>

        <p>Before glueing in the middle panel I did as much as I could:</p>
        <ul><li>Hinge pin was embedded</li>
        <li>Lips had been sanded down to equal size</li>
        <li>The shell had been cut down to within 3mm either side of his final shape</li>
        <li>Interior matt carbon fibre had been sanded smooth and blemish free</li>
        <li>The side panels all fitted nicely and the bag closed fine</li>
        <li>The center panel had been finished and coated with Awlgrip.</li>
        <li>The lower stops on the end panel were glued in place</li>
        <li>The strap fittings had been installed</li>
        <li>The utrasuede had been glued onto the end panels complete with the surrounding carbon fiber side strips</li>
        <li>Washed &amp; cleaned the shell and center panel soapy water</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The next step is to get the clip and two closing panels flush before I glue anything, including the clip to the hinge rod. What I found was with the bag tightly shut I couldn't get them to lie flush against the bag, instead if I opened the bag by maybe 1mm everything was fine. I have now added a bit of epoxy to the top inch or so of the end panels to open the bag out slightly and sand them so the closing panels &amp; clips fit well. I will have to work out how to do this earlier on in the process so I won't have to add black epoxy.</p>




        <h2 id="a27">&sect;27. Gluing it together</h2>
        <p>In the next bag, it may be worth chamfering edges of the side and bottom panels, such that there is an undercut, this will hopefully allow any excess glue to settled.</p>

        <p>After carefully lining up the bottom mould and holding it it place with magnets, I applied a small amount of cyano to each of the ends and let it seep under the bottom mould. This was enough to secure the bottom mould without magnets. I lined the bottom panel up by eye, prevoulsy making sure it closed correctly.</p>

        <p>I did notice a little ripple along the bottom of the bag, so it may be worth clamping a piece of wood across this to keep it flat during the gluing process, though how I would do this I am not sure as once clamped I won't be able to check how the bag closes. Maybe some long strip magnets might work, though they would likely be too powerful, or I could attach them to a flat peice of steel.</p>

        <p>In MC5 I improved the clamping of the bottom piece. I now have a steel rod running straight through the bag. This did involve cutting 6mm wholes through each end but they will be covered up. The use of this clamping system is very useful as I can now clamp the mould down well whilst still being able to close it. Again as mentioned above I line the mould up as best I could making sure the lips line up etc etc. and then put a pit of cyanno at both ends. By gluing the center section only I can still open up the bag the adavatage of which is that I can finish one half of it (ie. add the ultrasuede etc.) and be able to get a camera in to photograph the details.</p>

        <p>In the next bag, I need to work out the best routine for gluing the bag. I did make the mistake of wetting the bag before the glue was fully cured and I ended up with white bloom which I had to file off gently. If I let the cyano cure naturally I don't get it.</p>

        <p>It may be worth applying more glue to the top edges as when looking into the bag I am less likely to see any gluing errors.</p>

        <p>I just did a search on Cyanoacrylate and it seems that epoxy might be stronger. I may consider dripping epoxy around the bottom panel, instead of Cyanoacrylate.</p>



        <h2 id="a28">&sect;28. Strap</h2>
        <p>On the top of the end panels I have my strap release mechanism. The removable plate is now circular witha  virtical slot in it. When making the large hole through the end panel I should have previously stuck in the two carbon fiber strips, to save me having to drill the hole again in the strips. Also I cocked up the magnets slightly. Firstly the removable round discs should not have magnets in them, just a bit of steel as I don't want these sticking to anything in the bag and becoming detached from the bag. Secondly I put the side panels stops on after I had drill the hole and then had to dig out a rectangular hole for the magnet. It would have been a lot easier if i had stuck a thin bit of cf on the outside part of the end panels and stuck the magent on top of that, that way I would have got the magnet as close as possible to the disc. As it was I wasn't sure how far I could dig the hole.</p>

        <p>The side panel stops are 3.5mm thick? The discs are about 1.85 mm thick with a radius of 15mm. Some photos would be good. </p>


        <h3>&sect;28.1 Strap clasps</h3>
        <p>This goes in a new section. Once I have the two inner panels made and fitting, I can place them outside of the mould and draw a vertical line to the apex, I can drill a small hole 2cm from the top. This is where the strap will go. I will then place the inner panels back in there original place and  and extend this small hole through the end panels. I can now use this hole to line up everything. Next I drill and file a 7.5mm radius circle in the inner panel and as the inner panel will be about 2mm thick, I wont have to drill a large hole in the side panel.</p>





        <h2 id="a29">&sect;29. Cross section</h2>
        <p>The bag now has a standised cross section. The flat part is 1 7/8" wide with a 1 3/4 diameter curvre on each end. The curves occupy about 123 degrees. The height of the end panels is about 4 1/4" high.</p>

        <p>Becuase the curve in the lip starts too soon in MC1 and MC2, I will have to make a new mould for the main panel, such that the curved section is set an angle of 30<sup>o</sup> to the horizonatal. If I use this angle then this will mean that the angle at the apex should be 60<sup>o</sup> which helps define the bags shape.</p> 





        <h2 id="a30">&sect;30. Polishing notes</h2>
        <p>Start with maybe 1500 and if that doesn't remove the dust move down a grade, 1000, 800 etc. Once all the dust has gone work up to 2500. There should be no visible scratches by this stage, if there are then go back down a grade etc. I though I could do with out the heavy polishing compound, but after using the int. I could see reflections being diffuse horizontally and vertically. I then went on to do two passes with the heavy compound (note, a pass it twice over the piece, not adding any more compound). After doing this I could see horizontal lines (i couldn't feel then with my fingers). I put this down to fine scratches caused by the sandpaper, so I washed the cf. down with soapy water and went over it again with 1500, 2000 and 2500.</p>

        <p>When removing dust particles, use the finest sandpaper you can find. I used 1500 grid, but I will try and find 2000 grit.</p>

          <li>Carbon tube replaces Polymide tube as it was expensive.</li>
          <li>Gloss finish using urethane spray, okay but not as good as AwlGrip as it has picked up lots of scratches. Also the urethane has a slight tint to it which I don't like.</li>
          <li>Flat section was moulded against glass on which was a thin cured layer of epoxy. This gave a great finish, but increased the thickness slightly of the carbon. When I moulded it around the new mould there is slight rippling under the lip and I put this down to the extra thickness of the carbon.
          Ultarsuede end panels.</li>
          <li>Closing panel was made using 5 layers of carbon, 1 twill and 4 plain. I did have problems with moulding this and I would get slight ripples in the outer layer (peel ply side) of the carbon. Even though they were slight I couldn't really sand them down. I put this down to either moulding 5 layers in one go or wetting it out on a flat surafce first and then forming it around the mould. I fixed it my first moulding up 2 layers of carbon, letting it cure and then moulding the remaining three on top.</li>
          <li>May consider using epoxy to do the fianl glueing of the bottom panel.</li>
          <li>I glued in the bottom panel before adding the end stops, will this cause problems? Yes</li>
          <li>MC5 not finished because the side panels were a shade too short, the surface wasn't that great and I don't think I want to have the interior carbon matt. I shall however finish off the interior of it so I can take inside pictures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="mc6">MC6</h2>
        <ul class="variants">
          <li>Same as MC5 except that the carbon was set against the glass without the extra layer of epoxy. I rolled the carbon a great deal for this to cut down on the blemishes which ceartainly reduced them. </li>
          <li>Coating this bag in AwlGrip which is far superior. 
          Preparation for the AwlGrip follows. I thoroughly washed and scrubbed the carbon   with soapy liquid using a toothbrush. I then washed it down many times. After drying I cleaned it with AwlGrip de-greaser. I applied three layers the first day, followed by a fourth the following morning. I stopped beacuse the surface was free of the little grooves. The surface did pick up a bit of dust and the odd air bubble but I am going to see if I can remove these using the heavy buffing compound. If not then I will try 2500 grit and work down.</li>
          <li>I may want to increase the length of the side panels by 1mm to 22.4mm as with the ultrasuede, the end panels of MC5 are a little tight.</li>
          <li>Bottom panel used 2xtwill, 2xHS4 and 1xuni.</li>
          <li>Side panel used 2xtwill, 2xuni, 1xHS4</li>

        <h2 id="order">Order of construction</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>Make sure the lips have the same depth.</li>
        <li>Before the end stops are added, you need to know where the side panels will sit, so I need to get the bag closing correctly and have the inner ultrasuede panels fitting properly.</li>
        <li>Add the bottom end stops to the middle panel before you glue down the end panel. It's difficult to get the right shape otherwise. If you add them before you can oversize them and easily sand them back. </li>

        <li>Now I can glue in the middle panel. Make sure I add all the other previous steps. Maybe I should cut the clip hole out beforehand?</li>

        <li>Add the small ultrasuede pads (1cm x 2.3cm) to the side panesl before glueing the panels to the shell.</li>

        <li>I now have the middle panel tacked down with super glue along it's center line, the end stops have been super glued on and the side panels have had their ultrasuede tabs added. Next I tacked with superglue one of the center panels. I did the non-hinge side of MC5 as I am going to keep the other side open so I can photograph it.</li>
        </ol>


        <h2 id="a41">&sect;?. What I don't like about the bag</h2>
        <p>The gloss surface scratches and shows finger prints.</p>

        <p>Where I cut the end panels you can see the awlgrip coming off slightly</p>

        <p>Bottom of the bag has a slight wave in it.</p>

        <p>The thickeness of cf afer cured in a vacuum bag are as follows:</p>
        <p>1 layer of TAP plain = 0.25mm</p>
        <p>1 layer of uni-lateral = 0.21mm</p>
        <p>1 layer of twill, not sure but I am guess it will be around 0.2mm or less</p>


        <h3>&sect;6.6 The sanding block</h3>
        <p>The curved sanding block I am using to sand the lip has an internal radius of
        1.5&quot; which is what I want the outside radius of the lip to be, however the
        sand paper reduces the radius by .4mm which is perfect as it means that the
        sanded lip and single layer of carbon should give me 1.5&quot;. This applies to MC5, MC6 and MC7.</p>

        <p>The outside radius of the lips needs to match that of the closing panel. The lips are being sanded to a 3/4" radius curve and the closing panels was made using 3/4" radius tubes. The thickness of the closing lip will decrease it's radius slightly but I am not sure what I can do about that. Two things that help are that the sanding tube tightens up it's curvature when cut in half and the thickness of the sand paper on the sanding tube will reduces the radius further. I think I can get away with this.</p>


        <h2>Do we need this bit?  </h2>


        <p>I am now trying at this stage to get the outer coat final. Trying to apply a thin layer
        of epoxy after the ends were moulded as I suggested below didn't work. The epoxy was hard to 
        remove uniformly which wasn't helped by the fact that the bottom surface wasn't level any more 
        (due to the cf. build up)</p>

        <p>After I have  the correct surface, I will add mould release wax to it to make sure
        any further stages don't  cause epoxy to stick to it. Also I will have to be careful that none
        of the polishing wax gets onto the underneath surface. Leaving the peel ply on may help.</p>

        <p>Next stage is to add 2 of the 32 x
        14 twill to each side (cm x cm for small bag), this will be harder this time as I have to bend the flat outer
        sheet. I will try this on a smaller piece first to see how this goes. The twill pieces start 9cm and
        10cm from the center line. Bag up and allow to cure.</p>

        <p>Next stage is to lay the 10 pieces of the heavy twill
        (5 to each side). These get layed just as the curve
        starts so the thickness is added just to the curved
        lip. Bag and allow to cure. The smaller bag I just made had 12 pieces of plain on it. I made the strips 1.5"
        wide, but should have made them wider, 2.25 would probably be enough as it didn't wrap around enough and I had to build up with black epoxy. Building up with cf as opposed to epoxy may make it easier to build up a lip of uniform thickness. I found building up with epoxy slow as it ran and I had to apply it three times due to low spots</p>

        <p>Sand any excess cf resulting from the heavy twill,
        this is to keep the sides nice an flat. I also lightly
        sanded the side twill and fill in any dimples with
        epoxy. The idea is to get this surface nice and smooth
        so the top layer will need little finishing.</p>

        <p>Next stage is to added another 14x32 twill to each
        side, this time starting 11cm from the center. Bag
        and allow to cure.</p>

        <p>Next stage is to epoxy over the twill, sand smooth
        (adding more epoxy if necessary). I'm not sure when
        the best time it is to put the AllBrite on, maybe now
        as I have a nice flat surface to work with. If so I
        will need to wait a week for the epoxy to fully cure.
        I filled all the holes first with epoxy then I added
        two thin layers of epoxy, sanding after each coat. The
        last coat required light sanding and I also smoothed
        the lip as it had some small dimples - for this I used
        a thin piece of foam (cold meat packaging) which would
        bend to the contour. </p>

        <div class="old">
        <p>Old - I removed the mylar from the outside surface and
        lightly wet sanded it with water and soap to remove
        the blush, I also went over it with a tooth brush to
        get into any dimples. It looks like I can see and feel
        the fabric so i will go over this with epoxy and a
        razor blade to put a very thin film onto it. After
        that I fill sand gently until smooth, repeating the
        process if I still have dimples etc.</p>

        <p>In the meantime I can look at the outside surface.
        Clean off the blush and then fill all the small holes
        with epoxy, applied with a razor, this way I don't
        have to reply on the SparBrite to fill the holes.
        After this has all cured for a week i can start the
        SparBrite coats.</p>

        <p>Old - The end gusset panels are now thicker. Currently I am
        using 5 layers of thick twill - not sure the
        measurements so I need to check it out. To make sure I
        got a good angle I used the convex piece and mould a
        single layer (with veil on top). This gave me a nice
        internal corner. Once cured I added another 4 layers
        of thick twill, again just using the convex mould. The
        outer edge of this came out rounded so I built it up
        with black epoxy. I was going to added an extra layer
        of twill but I don't want to bugger this up, so
        instead I will just epoxy a nice piece to one side
        where you will see it. This way I can make it thicker
        quite easily - it's already strong so i don't have to
        worry about that. I will have to add black epoxy to it
        first and sand it flat first.</p>

        <p>The reason this is a lot thicker now is that I want
        the lining to be flush with it.</p>
