<h4 align=center>Main panel</h4>
<a name=main_panel></a>
<h4>Moulding panel flat<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>Moulded flat on glass sheet. First lay down the main twill, followed by the veil. I added the veil to
help fill in any holes in the twill prior to adding the uni-lateral cf. etc. Not sure it helps that much, 
but it probably helps stop the AwlGrip bleed through a bit. I also leave the peel ply on until I need to bond
 to the surface, as the ply keeps it clean. It's a good idea to sand the ply down slightly as you will find small 
 pin sized points of epoxy due to the realse film. Removing these little bumps help the sheet lie flatter for polishing/sanding etc.</p>
 
 <p>This initial flat piece is 12"x18". The last one I did, I didn't add the viel, rather I was going to add it over the uni-lateral. 
 I will see how this goes.</p>

<a name=polishing></a>
<h4>Polishing the panel<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>My latest approach is to remove the blush and lightly sand. After letting the epoxy cure for 7 to 10 days, 
I apply 3 layers of AllBrite. After this has cured for three or four days I sand the surface smooth, and add a final coat of AllBrite.
This surface should be almost perfect (as it is) apart from the odd bit of dust. Leaving the peel 
ply helps prevent AllBrite bleed through. I now polish the surface with a car buffer and am now getting a good reflective surface.
 See below for <a href=#polishing>polishing tips.</a>. After polishing I apply a layer of release wax in case any epoxy gets on this surface.</p>

<a name=creating_lip></a>
<h4>Creating the curved lip<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>Side pieces start from 7.5cms &amp; and 8cms from the center line. New
approach is to keep the sides fairly thin and just build up on the curved handle.</p>


<p>I add two layers of cf before the uni as once I have formed the lip I know how the bag will lie in order to get the
direction of the cf. uni tow running in the correct direction (I noticed that the bag would twist slightly when 
I bent it into shape on a previous one which could have been due to the direction of the fibers). I can't remember the 
exact sizes of the plain cf. I use to
form the lip, but they start 7.5cms and 8cms from the center line. 
Because the sheet is flat and I have to mould it around a curve, I taped the sheet securely to the marble. 
Taping it is also necessary as I need to line up the above pieces of cf. 
Once the cf is in place I bend the cf around the marble with the peel ply. 
Further layers of release film, breather etc. all help secure it. The moulding came out fine.</p>

<p>Once the l;ip is formed I add the uni cf. making sure the fibers all line up. I added the whole 12" width. I probably should cover the whole
panel in uni, using multiple pieces so I get a uniform thickness without a lip. In the latest bag I will also add
viel on top of this to help hold the uni cf. in place. The uni cf. only adds about 0.2 mm to the thickness which can be smoothed down later. 
After the uni and the viel have cured I trim the lip off at 180 degrees.</p>


<a name=forming_lip></a>
<h4>Building up the lip<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>

<p>As I have remade the mould to form the lip, the radius of the lip has changed. The inside radius was 1.5" and now it is
1.25". I plan to have the outside radius 1.5" which means that the lip will be 1/8" thick, and it will have the correct radius
of the clip. I do not currently know how many layers I will need to build it up or the best way to hind the hinge tube.</p>

<p>The current bag has a lip of 1 twill and 2 plain cf. It is still pretty thin but maybe when I build up the full thickness and add cf to the 
top it will toughen up. I have sanded down the 2mm tube to 1.6mm and the existing 3 layer lip is 0.9mm. If I want a 1/8" thick lip (3.2mm) this gives
me 0.7mm for the top layers of cf. This will give me enough space for one layer of uni, one of plain and an outer one of twill. I think
6 layers of cf. will make it strong enough.</p>

<p>Once I have finished the current bag I can assess the hinge palcement. The new bag will have the hinge super glued to the lip
and I will use black eponxy to build the lip up, followed by the 3 top layers of cf. Previously I fully formed the lip then made a 
grove in it for hinge tube. I think this new way will be easier.</p>

<p>I have also thought of putting a curve in the lip, however this will epose the hinge tube and now I'm not
sure how it will look.</p>

<p>In getting this curve correct I also cut back the lip so that it's curvature was maybe 160 degrees. 
I did this with the dremel cut off wheel - worked like a charm. To get the two lips exactly the same, I have a sanding 
jig so both lips are the same. The depth of this jig may change with the new narrower lip, but I will use some form of it.</p>



<a name=insert><div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></a>
<h4>Making the bottom insert</h4>
<p>The bottom and end plates are now moulded into a single piece, using 2 layers of twill and 3 of uni. The inside profile
of the mould was based upon a flat section of 1 7/8" with a radius of 1 3/4". The outide mould profile is 1 7/8" flat section and 
curves of radius 1 7/8". Then length of the inner mould is approximately 8.5" long. When cutting out the end panels from this 
moulded section I use a 1 7/8" flat section with curves of radius 23mm and a height of about 11.5 cms, though this is just a guide 
as the bottom line is that I have to cut it so the bag closes.</p>

<p>When moulding this piece I use slow setting epoxy to give time for the bubbles to escape and I take my time laying out the 
carbon fiber making sure the gussets in the cloth are at a minimal.</p>

<p>The inside end panel now has a ultrasuede lining. So that I don't get an exposed edge I now have two strips of carbon fiber 
running up on either side. The current ones are a bit on the thin side, ideally I would like about 1.2mm.</p>

<p>I thought about using white ultrasuede for the lining, but I rubbed some carbon fiber slurry on a test piece and I couldn't
wash it clean. I am now using black ultrasuede. To glue it, once I had the correct shape. I used magnets to hold the top of it in
place whilst I applies glue to the bottom area. I used a small plastic strip to help smear the glue on the carbon, but on the
ultrasuede I just applied it straight out of the tube.</p>

<p>For the inside design, see picture below:</p>
<a href=./bottom_panel2_fig.html>Original 2cm bottom panel</a> (full size image)<br>
<a href=./bottom_panel_fig.html>1.5cm bottom panel</a> (full size image).


<a name=strap><div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></a>
<h4>Strap</h4>
<p>On the top of the end panels I have my strap release mechanism. The removable plate is now circular witha  virtical slot in it.
When making the large hole through the end panel I should have previously stuck in the two carbon fiber strips, to save me 
having to drill the hole again in the strips. Also I cocked up the magnets slightly. Firstly the removable round discs should not
have magnets in them, just a bit of steel as I don't want these sticking to anything in the bag and becoming detached from the bag.
Secondly I put the side panels stops on after I had drill the hole and then had to dig out a rectangular hole for the magnet.
It would have been a lot easier if i had stuck a thin bit of cf on the outside part of the end panels and stuck the magent on top
of that, that way I would have got the magnet as close as possible to the disc. As it was I wasn't sure how far I could dig the hole.</p>

<p>The side panel stops are 3.5mm thick? The discs are about 1.85 mm thick with a radius of 15mm. Some photos would be good. </p>





<a name=channel><div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></a>
<h4>Making the channel for the hinge</h4>
<p>Before I put on the final layer of twill I am going to insert a hinge tube into the lip. This will now be held in
 firmly by the twill and will not extend through the bottom of the lip. </p>

<p>Before I put on the final layer of twill on the inside I need to do some things:</p>

1. I need to work out far down to lay the twill.<br>
2. I need to embed the hinge tube<br>
3. I need to put some magnets in the lip<br>

<p>So what do I need to do this?</p>

<p>1. Because the bag has a uniform cross section By drawing out the cross section I can roughly work out where the 
bag will stop bending. 1/78" for the bottom and the 2 x 123/360 the circumference of the a 1/3/4 dia circle. 
I estimated 7.2cms form the center of the bag. I went for 7.5cms from the center to start the final twill and that was final.
In fact this shouldn't be the final layer. This piece of twill should be put down when forming the lip.</p>

<p>2. I need to work out where to put the tube, I need the distance from the edge of the lip and I need it parallel to the lip. 
I am going to use the dimensions of the previous bag for the lip. How do I work out where my current closing flap should sit? 
I need to put in the end panels - make sure they are identical, put a few bands around the bag and make sure the lips are level - 
I will have to us my eye for this, then placing the flap on top mark where it stops on all four corners, then put a lip on the 
marble and mark off on the marble where the flap will come too. Try this on the other flap and hopefully the measurements will 
agree. Now I have to make sure that the imaginary line of the end of the lip is parallelm how do i do this. I have a mark each 
side of the marble but is his parallel? I can maybe use one of the acrylic tubes? It would be handing is I had the large tube 
cut in half - maybe I will do that - cutting it into thirds would be better,
maybe able to do that with my dremel cutting blade and do a little sanding..... I think i can do a good job by laying my tube next to it.</p>

<p>So once I have the edge of my lip a can mask across and draw a line. Then work out how far in using as a guide the old bag. Re-assemble the bag and check against the existing lip flap.</p>

<p>I then need to grind in a channel - I need to know how far I can go down and make sure I don't go through - 
I can always sand the tube a bit if need be. I was having some ideas of putting magnets in this tube so some how 
position the ninge pin - think about this</p>

<p>Current centerline of hinge is 6mm from edge of lip on large bag and I will use this distance.</p>


 <strong>   
 Do we need this bit?  
<p>I am now trying at this stage to get the outer coat final. Trying to apply a thin layer
of epoxy after the ends were moulded as I suggested below didn't work. The epoxy was hard to 
remove uniformly which wasn't helped by the fact that the bottom surface wasn't level any more 
(due to the cf. build up)</p>



<p>After I have  the correct surface, I will add mould release wax to it to make sure
any further stages don't  cause epoxy to stick to it. Also I will have to be careful that none
of the polishing wax gets onto the underneath surface. Leaving the peel ply on may help.</p>

<p>Next stage is to add 2 of the 32 x
14 twill to each side (cm x cm for small bag), this will be harder this time as I have to bend the flat outer
sheet. I will try this on a smaller piece first to see how this goes. The twill pieces start 9cms and
10cms from the center line. Bag up and allow to cure.</p>

<p>Next stage is to lay the 10 pieces of the heavy twill
(5 to each side). These get layed just as the curve
starts so the thickness is added just to the curved
lip. Bag and allow to cure. The smaller bag I just made had 12 pieces of plain on it. I made the strips 1.5"
wide, but should have made them wider, 2.25 would probably be enough as it didn't wrap around enough and I had to build up with black epoxy. Building up with cf as opposed to epoxy may make it easier to build up a lip of uniform thickness. I found building up with epoxy slow as it ran and I had to apply it three times due to low spots</p>

<p>Sand any excess cf resulting from the heavy twill,
this is to keep the sides nice an flat. I also lightly
sanded the side twill and fill in any dimples with
epoxy. The idea is to get this surface nice and smooth
so the top layer will need little finishing.</p>

<p>Next stage is to added another 14x32 twill to each
side, this time starting 11cms from the center. Bag
and allow to cure.</p>

<p>Next stage is to epoxy over the twill, sand smooth
(adding more epoxy if necessary). I'm not sure when
the best time it is to put the AllBrite on, maybe now
as I have a nice flat surface to work with. If so I
will need to wait a week for the epoxy to fully cure.
I filled all the holes first with epoxy then I added
two thin layers of epoxy, sanding after each coat. The
last coat required light sanding and I also smoothed
the lip as it had some small dimples - for this I used
a thin piece of foam (cold meat packaging) which would
bend to the contour. </p></strong>

<cite><p>Old - I removed the mylar from the outside surface and
lightly wet sanded it with water and soap to remove
the blush, I also went over it with a tooth brush to
get into any dimples. It looks like I can see and feel
the fabric so i will go over this with epoxy and a
razor blade to put a very thin film onto it. After
that I fill sand gently until smooth, repeating the
process if I still have dimples etc.</p>

<p>In the meantime I can look at the outside surface.
Clean off the blush and then fill all the small holes
with epoxy, applied with a razor, this way I don't
have to reply on the SparBrite to fill the holes.
After this has all cured for a week i can start the
SparBrite coats.</p></cite>

<cite><p>Old - The end gusset panels are now thicker. Currently I am
using 5 layers of thick twill - not sure the
measurements so I need to check it out. To make sure I
got a good angle I used the convex piece and mould a
single layer (with veil on top). This gave me a nice
internal corner. Once cured I added another 4 layers
of thick twill, again just using the convex mould. The
outer edge of this came out rounded so I built it up
with black epoxy. I was going to added an extra layer
of twill but I don't want to bugger this up, so
instead I will just epoxy a nice piece to one side
where you will see it. This way I can make it thicker
quite easily - it's already strong so i don't have to
worry about that. I will have to add black epoxy to it
first and sand it flat first.</p>

<p>The reason this is a lot thicker now is that I want
the lining to be flush with it.</p></cite>

<a name=flat_ends></a>
<h4>End panels - flat<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>1 layer of twill<br>
2 layers of plain</p>


<a name=angle_bracket></a>
<h4>Angle brackets<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>I am now making these thicker so the neoprene is flush. I now mould two smaller pieces at one time
instead of one larger piece, this is because I was getting air bubbles. I also position the mould
so the 90 degree angle is pointing down, this gives air bubbles a chance to rise. Each piece is about 20 cms
x 17cms. I use 6 layers 2 of twill and 4 of TAP plain weave. I layed all the cf. out on mylar first and used 
a roller to remove air bubbles (the brush adds bubbles), I then lifted the pieces onto the mould. The last one I did came out fine.</p>

<p>The 6 layers came to between 1.25 and 1.7mm, I don't think the variation will make that much difference and it's about the right thickness (1/16 = 1.5mm)</p>

<p><cite>Old - 2 layers of twill (outside layers)<br>
2 layers of plain</cite></p>

<a name=closing_panel></a>
<h4>Closing panel<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>Currently using two pieces of TAP plain and two pieces of twill. I apply thin coat(s) of epoxy to the underside which will 
be visible on on eside and also gives a better gluing surface on the other. The last one I did, I just sanded the underside 
and it looked fine. I did try three layers of cf, 1 twill and 2 plain, but it was too flexible. I will coat this with 
standard urethane.</p>

<p>As long as the panel is at least 4 layers thick (4 x twill or 2 x twill and 2 x plain or similar combinations),
it doesn't matter what thickness it is though it may be nicer to make it even thicker, so that I can round the edge
and make it less likely to scratch you.</p>

<p>The important thing is that the closing panel is made up with the same layout as the closing clip and to make sure
all with parts lie flush before gluing etc. I noticed on the current bag that on one side the closing panel doesn't 
lie flat against the lip. I can fix this by adding a small bit of black epoxy and sanding to fit. This would be on
the hinge side so you won't see it.</p>


<a name=clip></a>
<h4>Clip<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>The hinge will use the same layout as the closing panel with the addition of a lip. The current 
clip that I am using is about 0.8mm thin, whilst the closing panel I have is about 1.2mm. Although the
difference isn't much it means with the clip closed, the closing panels do not lie flush. As the clip
currently fits I will remake the closing panel. Now I know the clip used 4 layers so I am guessing I 
used 4 layers of twill. I should make more notes.</p>

<p>The hinge will be embedded in the lip of the bag. I have ordered 2mm tube and 1mm rod for this
purpose. I am planning of embedding this into the lip bag so you will not see it - the current 
prototype shows the hinge casing if you look underneath. I will do this by cutting a channel into 
the top of the lip, deep enough to cover the tube but not deep enough that I make a hole completely
through the lip. My plan is to embed a 2" or so tube into the lip before I put the outer layer of twill
over it. The purpose of this is that the extra layer of cf on top will securely hold the tube in 
place as I don't want it ripping out, though in the current bag I am not adding an additional layer of cf,
my thinking being that I have the closing panels glued on top.</p>

<p>I will sink a single hinge tube rather than two pieces, the open ends being exposed when I cut a slot in the lip,
this assures me that the pin holes will line up. I need to make sure that the depth of this tube is uniform.</p>

<p>In order the embed the tube I need to work out where to make the channel. If I cut the closing panel 
to the currect size, then placing it over the bag will allow me to gauge where to put it, currenty the hinge 
center is about 5mm from the outside. I am planning on using the same size lip as on the larger bag.</p>

<p>I want the clip to have a weak link so that if the clip gets caught on something, the bag won't
get ripped apart. For this I will be using a 1mm cf hinge rod which I may even score to make more likely 
to break.</p>

<p>For the next bag I will simply glue the tube onto the thin carbon fibre lib and build up with black epoxy,
covering it all with a couple of layers of twill.</p> 

<p>I know have a better idea for the clip. Because I had to make clip a reasonable thickness (if the clip and 
the closing panel are too thin, they would probably catch your hand etc.) it meant that the latch section of the clip
wasn't flexible which meant that I could only have a very small lip on it and even with that it took a little force. 
My new idea is to make another clip out of 3 ply cf, cut it in half along its lenth and glue that on top of the 
existing clip. The vertical latch part would not be glued, so giving me the extra flexibility I wanted. For the catch
area I will glue some sort of carbon fiber rod. Currently my plan is to cut the vertical part off from the full clip. I
can't see any reason to keep it. I did try making this latch clip out of two ply but it felt too flexible.</p>


<a name=pin></a>
<h4>Hinge pin<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>The current spring loaded pin is made as follows. The pin composes of tow pieces, each one 25mm long and is 
comprised of two pieces, the inner tbe which is 25mm x 1mm rod, sanded slightly so it will fit within a 1.8mm x 1mm
tube. The 1.8mm tube is cut to a length of 16mm and sanded slightly so that it fits within a 3.1mm x 1.8mm tube. The
1.8mm tube is superglued over the inner rod such that 5mm sticks out of one end and 4mm out of the other end. The outer 
3.1mm tube is about 56mm long. </p>

<p>On the 4mm end of the 1mm rod I put a spring (0.057" OD x 0.008 WD x 0.375 FL, part number csmw-003). To keep the 
springs apart I add a 5mm space which consists of a section of the 1.8mm tube with rod glued inside.</p>

<p>The carbon fiber rods and tubes come from RCFoam.com and I believe the manufacturer is Galaxys International. I am
not sure where I got the 3.1mm x 1.8mm tube, but RCFoam do stock a 3.0 x 2.0mm and a 3.5 x 1.8mm tube which I may try.
I found it too fiddling trying to sand the 1.8mm tube to fit nicely into 2.5mm x 1.7mm tube. The 1.8mm tube fits in
the 3.1 x 1.8mm tube with very little sanding. I think it will be worth trying the 3.0mm x 2.0mm tube next.
Although the difference in diamters is only small and sometimes the same, nothing fits without sanding and with the
previous 2.5mm x 1.7mm tube I had to do a lot of sanding of the 1.8mm tube and my eventual fit was a bit loose and I 
suspect the tube wasn't very round either.</p>


<a name=cross_section></a>
<h4>Cross section<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>The bag now has a standised cross section. The flat part is 1&7/8" wide with a 1&3/4 diameter curvle on each end. 
The curves occupy about 123 degrees. The height of the end panels is about 4 1/4" high.</p>

<a name=together></a>
<h4>Putting it all together<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>This is the part I was dreading, when do I glue in the bottom panel? The advantage of having it glued is that 
it won't move and I don't have to use magnets. The disadvantages are that the bag is harder to work with etc. However,
it has to be done sometime, but when? I have now glued in the bottom panel, at either end and the middle section. I 
lined up the lips by eye, made sure the closing panels fit reasonably well (I will have to add black epoxy for a perfect fit)
and used magnets at the end and in the middle.</p>

<p>Before glueing in the middle panel I did as much as I could:
<ul><li>Hinge pin was embedded</li>
<li>Lips had been sanded down to equal size</li>
<li>The shall had been cut down to within 3mm either side of his final shape</li>
<li>Interior matt carbon fibre had been sanded smooth and blemish free</li>
<li>The side panels all fitted nicely and the bag closed fine</li>
<li>The center panel had been finished and coated with Awlgrip.</li>
<li>The lower stops on the end panel were glued in place</li>
<li>The strap fittings had been installed</li>
<li>The utrasuede had been glued onto the end panels complete with the surrounding carbon fiber side strips</li>
<li>Washed & cleaned the shell and center panel soapy water</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The next step is to get the clip and two closing panels flush before I glue anything, including
the clip to the hinge rod. What I found was with the bag tightly shut I couldn't get them to lie
flush against the bag, instead if I opened the bag by maybe 1mm everything was fine. I have now added
a bit of epoxy to the top inch or so of the end panels to open the bag out slightly and sand them
so the closing panels & clips fit well. I will have to work out how to do this earlier on in the
process so I won't have to add black epoxy.</p>


<a name=polishing_tips></a>
<h4>Polishing notes<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>Start with maybe 1500 and if that doesn't remove the dust move down a grade, 1000, 800 etc. Once all
the dust has gone work up to 2500. There should be no visible scratches by this stage, if there are then go back down a grade etc. I though I could do with out the heavy polishing compound, but after using the int. I could see reflections being diffuse horizontally and vertically. I then went on to do two passes with the heavy compound (note, a pass it twice over the piece, not adding any more compound). After doing this I could see horizontal lines (i couldn't feel then with my fingers). I put this down to fine scratches caused by the sandpaper, so 
I washed the cf. down with soapy water and went over it again with 1500, 2000 and 2500.

 When removing dust particles, use the finest sandpaper you can find. I used 1500 grid, but I will try and find 2000 grit.</p>
