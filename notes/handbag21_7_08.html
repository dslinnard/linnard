<h4 align=center>Main panel</h4>
<a name=main_panel></a>
<h4>Moulding panel flat<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>Moulded flat on glass sheet. First lay down the main twill, followed by the veil. I added the veil to
help fill in any holes in the twill prior to adding the uni-lateral cf. etc. Not sure it helps that much, 
but it probably helps stop the AwlGrip bleed through a bit. I also leave the peel ply on until I need to bond
 to the surface, as the ply keeps it clean. It's a good idea to sand the ply down slightly as you will find small 
 pin sized pomts of epoxy due to the realse film. Removing these little bumps help the sheet lie flatter for polishing/sanding etc.</p>

<a name=polishing></a>
<h4>Polishing the panel<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>My latest approach is to remove the blush and lightly sand. After letting the epoxy cure for 7 to 10 days, 
I apply 3 layers of AllBrite. After this has cured for three or four days I sand the surface smooth, and add a final coat of AllBrite.
This surface should be almost perfect (as it is) apart from the odd bit of dust. Leaving the peel 
ply helps prevent AllBrite bleed through. I now polish the surface wityh a car buffer and am now getting a good reflective surface.  See below for <a href=#polishing>polishing tips.</a>. After polishing I apply a layer of release wax in case any epoxy gets on this surface.</p>

<a name=creating_lip></a>
<h4>Creating the curved lip<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>Side pieces start from 9cms &amp; 10cms (8 &amp; 9cms for the smaller bag) from the center line. New
approach is to keep the sides fairly thin and just build up on the curved handle.</p>

<p>Before I mould the curved lips I add the unilateral cf. to the center. It comes in 1ft width so I may as well add the
full width. It only adds about 0.2 mm to the thickness which can be smoothed down later. This will be moulded against the glass.
make sure the fibres are orientated correctly as this effects how the bag curves - I noticed that the bag would twist slightly when 
I bent it into shape.</p>

<p>I add two layers of cf, 32x14 &amp; and 32x13 plain to each side (?? x 12cm and ?? x 13cm for small bag). 
Because the sheet is flat and I have to mould it around a curve, I taped the sheet securely to the marble. 
Taping it is also necessary as I need to line up the above pieces of cf. 
Once the cf is in place I bend the cf around the marble with the peel ply. 
Further layers of release film, breather etc. all help secure it. The moulding came out fine.</p>



<a name=forming_lip></a>
<h4>Building up the lip<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>

<p>As I have remade the mould to form the lip, the radius of the lip has changed. The inside radius was 1.5" and now it is
1.25". I plan to have the outside radius 1.5" which means that the lip will be 1/8" thick, and it will have the correct radius
of the clip. I do not currently know how many layers I will need to build it up or the best way to hind the hinge tube.</p>

<p>Next stage is to build up the thickness of the lip so I can countersink a hinge into it. On the smaller bag 
I added an additional 13 layers of plain cf. The width of these peices (1.5") was too narrow and I had to build 
up with black epoxy. Next time I will try 2.25". I applied these pieces in two goes, 6 the first time, 7 the second. 
I sanded the bump which extended into the body of the bag flat each time.</p>

<p>As I was building up the thickeness I found that the radius of the lip was increasing which meant that the closing 
panel wouldn't sit well. To fix this I made a long circular sanding block (radius 1.5") and built up the lip with epoxy and 
sand back into a perfect 1.5" radius. I'm please with this as before I wasn't happy with the fit, but wasn't sure 
how to fix it. The fit of the closing plate is about 95% I will leave the last 5% for when I have the final twill in place.</p>

<p>Next time I may not add so many layers of carbon fiber but put a thicker layer of epoxy.</p>

<p>In getting this curve correct I also cut back the lip so that it's curvature was maybe 160 degrees, this helped as after this 
lip stopped curving and goes off at an angle. I did this with the dremel cut off wheel - worked like a charm.</p>

<a name=insert><div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></a>
<h4>Making the bottom insert</h4>
<p>I have decided that I am going to join the two end panels by a piece of carbon fiber which will run along the bottom 
of the bag, over the join I will put a nice piece of twill. This will look pleasing as well as reinforce
the bottom of the bag. I am not sure how I will assemble this yet, whether to make it into one piece first and then 
glue it into the bag of glue it in in parts. I think for now I will glue it in in parts.</p>



<a name=channel><div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></a>
<h4>Making the channel for the hinge</h4>
<p>Before I put on the final layer of twill I am going to insert a hinge tube into the lip. This will now be held in
 firmly by the twill and will not extend through the bottom of the lip. </p>

<p>Before I put on the final layer of twill on the inside I need to do some things:</p>

1. I need to work out far down to lay the twill.<br>
2. I need to embed the hinge tube<br>
3. I need to put some magnets in the lip<br>

<p>So what do I need to do this?</p>

<p>1. Because the bag has a uniform cross section By drawing out the cross section I can roughly work out where the 
bag will stop bending. 1/78" for the bottom and the 2 x 123/360 the circumference of the a 1/3/4 dia circle. 
I estimated 7.2cms form the center of the bag. I went for 7.5cms from the center to start the final twill and that was final.
In fact this shouldn't be the final layer. This piece of twill should be put down when forming the lip.</p>

<p>2. I need to work out where to put the tube, I need the distance from the edge of the lip and I need it parallel to the lip. 
I am going to use the dimensions of the previous bag for the lip. How do I work out where my current closing flap should sit? 
I need to put in the end panels - make sure they are identical, put a few bands around the bag and make sure the lips are level - 
I will have to us my eye for this, then placing the flap on top mark where it stops on all four corners, then put a lip on the 
marble and mark off on the marble where the flap will come too. Try this on the other flap and hopefully the measurements will 
agree. Now I have to make sure that the imaginary line of the end of the lip is parallelm how do i do this. I have a mark each 
side of the marble but is his parallel? I can maybe use one of the acrylic tubes? It would be handing is I had the large tube 
cut in half - maybe I will do that - cutting it into thirds would be better,
maybe able to do that with my dremel cutting blade and do a little sanding..... I think i can do a good job by laying my tube next to it.</p>

<p>So once I have the edge of my lip a can mask across and draw a line. Then work out how far in using as a guide the old bag. Re-assemble the bag and check against the existing lip flap.</p>

<p>I then need to grind in a channel - I need to know how far I can go down and make sure I don't go through - 
I can always sand the tube a bit if need be. I was having some ideas of putting magnets in this tube so some how 
position the ninge pin - think about this</p>

<p>Current centerline of hinge is 6mm from edge of lip on large bag and I will use this distance.</p>


 <strong>   
 Do we need this bit?  
<p>I am now trying at this stage to get the outer coat final. Trying to apply a thin layer
of epoxy after the ends were moulded as I suggested below didn't work. The epoxy was hard to 
remove uniformly which wasn't helped by the fact that the bottom surface wasn't level any more 
(due to the cf. build up)</p>



<p>After I have  the correct surface, I will add mould release wax to it to make sure
any further stages don't  cause epoxy to stick to it. Also I will have to be careful that none
of the polishing wax gets onto the underneath surface. Leaving the peel ply on may help.</p>

<p>Next stage is to add 2 of the 32 x
14 twill to each side (cm x cm for small bag), this will be harder this time as I have to bend the flat outer
sheet. I will try this on a smaller piece first to see how this goes. The twill pieces start 9cms and
10cms from the center line. Bag up and allow to cure.</p>

<p>Next stage is to lay the 10 pieces of the heavy twill
(5 to each side). These get layed just as the curve
starts so the thickness is added just to the curved
lip. Bag and allow to cure. The smaller bag I just made had 12 pieces of plain on it. I made the strips 1.5"
wide, but should have made them wider, 2.25 would probably be enough as it didn't wrap around enough and I had to build up with black epoxy. Building up with cf as opposed to epoxy may make it easier to build up a lip of uniform thickness. I found building up with epoxy slow as it ran and I had to apply it three times due to low spots</p>

<p>Sand any excess cf resulting from the heavy twill,
this is to keep the sides nice an flat. I also lightly
sanded the side twill and fill in any dimples with
epoxy. The idea is to get this surface nice and smooth
so the top layer will need little finishing.</p>

<p>Next stage is to added another 14x32 twill to each
side, this time starting 11cms from the center. Bag
and allow to cure.</p>

<p>Next stage is to epoxy over the twill, sand smooth
(adding more epoxy if necessary). I'm not sure when
the best time it is to put the AllBrite on, maybe now
as I have a nice flat surface to work with. If so I
will need to wait a week for the epoxy to fully cure.
I filled all the holes first with epoxy then I added
two thin layers of epoxy, sanding after each coat. The
last coat required light sanding and I also smoothed
the lip as it had some small dimples - for this I used
a thin piece of foam (cold meat packaging) which would
bend to the contour. </p></strong>

<cite><p>Old - I removed the mylar from the outside surface and
lightly wet sanded it with water and soap to remove
the blush, I also went over it with a tooth brush to
get into any dimples. It looks like I can see and feel
the fabric so i will go over this with epoxy and a
razor blade to put a very thin film onto it. After
that I fill sand gently until smooth, repeating the
process if I still have dimples etc.</p>

<p>In the meantime I can look at the outside surface.
Clean off the blush and then fill all the small holes
with epoxy, applied with a razor, this way I don't
have to reply on the SparBrite to fill the holes.
After this has all cured for a week i can start the
SparBrite coats.</p></cite>

<cite><p>Old - The end gusset panels are now thicker. Currently I am
using 5 layers of thick twill - not sure the
measurements so I need to check it out. To make sure I
got a good angle I used the convex piece and mould a
single layer (with veil on top). This gave me a nice
internal corner. Once cured I added another 4 layers
of thick twill, again just using the convex mould. The
outer edge of this came out rounded so I built it up
with black epoxy. I was going to added an extra layer
of twill but I don't want to bugger this up, so
instead I will just epoxy a nice piece to one side
where you will see it. This way I can make it thicker
quite easily - it's already strong so i don't have to
worry about that. I will have to add black epoxy to it
first and sand it flat first.</p>

<p>The reason this is a lot thicker now is that I want
the lining to be flush with it.</p></cite>

<a name=moulded_ends></a>
<h4>End panels - moulded<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>I am now making these thicker so the neoprene is flush. Each piece is 7"x5" (or 8"x5" for large bag).
I use 5 layers of plain cf. (8.7oz from TAP) and 1 layer of twill for the inside. I mould between my two
mould pieces, laying the cf. straight onto the waxed mould. I set it flat side down. The last one I
tilted up a little to give any bubbles a better chance to escape - not sure whether this makes
any difference. So far the pieces have turned out fine.</p>
<p>The 6 layers came to between 1.1 and 1.3mm, I don't think the variation will make that much difference. This is a bit thinner than the angle bracket, but it's deep in the bag so I shall use the current ones. next time I will try another layer of TAP plain (7 layers in total) (1/16 = 1.5mm)</p>

<p>I am also experimenting with using twill on the outside and the very course twill for the inside (3 layers)
as I have a lot of the course cf. I need to measure the thickness. Ideally I'm after about 1mm.</p>

<p><cite>Old - 3 layers of plain weave each 5" x 8"</cite></p>

<a name=flat_ends></a>
<h4>End panels - flat<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>1 layer of twill<br>
2 layers of plain</p>


<a name=angle_bracket></a>
<h4>Angle brackets<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>I am now making these thicker so the neoprene is flush. I now mould two smaller pieces at one time
instead of one larger piece, this is because I was getting air bubbles. I also position the mould
so the 90 degree angle is pointing down, this gives air bubbles a chance to rise. Each piece is about 20 cms
x 17cms. I use 6 layers 2 of twill and 4 of TAP plain weave. I layed all the cf. out on mylar first and used 
a roller to remove air bubbles (the brush adds bubbles), I then lifted the pieces onto the mould. The last one I did came out fine.</p>

<p>The 6 layers came to between 1.25 and 1.7mm, I don't think the variation will make that much difference and it's about the right thickness (1/16 = 1.5mm)</p>

<p><cite>Old - 2 layers of twill (outside layers)<br>
2 layers of plain</cite></p>

<a name=closing_panel></a>
<h4>Closing panel<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>Currently using three pieces of TAP plain and one piece of twill. I apply thin coat(s) of epoxy to the underside which will 
be visible on on eside and also gives a better gluing surface on the other. I will coat this with standard urethane.</p>


<a name=clip></a>
<h4>Clip<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>The hinge will use the same layout as the closing panel as well with the addition of a lip.</p>
<p>The hinge will be embedded in the lip of the bag. I have ordered 2mm tube and 1mm rod for this
purpose. I am planning of embedding this into the lip bag so you will not see it - the current 
prototype shows the hinge casing if you look underneath. I will do this by cutting a channel into 
the top of the lip, deep enough to cover the tube but not deep enough that I make a hole completely
through the lip. My plan is to embed a 2" or so tube into the lip before I put the outer layer of twill
over it. The purpose of this is that the extra layer of cf on top will securely hold the tube in 
place as I don't want it ripping out.</p>

<p>I will sink a single hinge tube rather than two pieces, the open ends being exposed when I cut a slot in the lip.</p>

<p>In order the embed the tube I need to work out where to make the channel. If I cut the closing panel 
to the currect size, then placing it over the bag will allow me to gaugae where to put it, currenty the hinge 
center is about 5mm from the outside. I am planning on using the same size lip as on the larger bag.</p>


<p>I want the clip to have a weak link so that if the clip gets caught on something, the bag won't
get ripped apart. For this I will be using a 1mm cf hinge rod which I may even score to make more likely 
to break.</p>

<a name=cross_section></a>
<p>The bag now has a standised cross section. The flat part is 1&7/8" wide with a 1&3/4 diameter curvle on each end. 
The curves occupy about 123 degrees. The height of the end panels is about 4 1/4" high.</p>


<a name=polishing_tips></a>
<h4>Polishing notes<div align=right>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#top>Top</a></div></h4>
<p>Start with maybe 1500 and if that doesn't remove the dust move down a grade, 1000, 800 etc. Once all
the dust has gone work up to 2500. There should be no visible scratches by this stage, if there are then go back down a grade etc. I though I could do with out the heavy polishing compound, but after using the int. I could see reflections being diffuse horizontally and vertically. I then went on to do two passes with the heavy compound (note, a pass it twice over the piece, not adding any more compound). After doing this I could see horizontal lines (i couldn't feel then with my fingers). I put this down to fine scratches caused by the sandpaper, so 
I washed the cf. down with soapy water and went over it again with 1500, 2000 and 2500.

 When removing dust particles, use the finest sandpaper you can find. I used 1500 grid, but I will try and find 2000 grit.</p>
