<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm David, Matthew's brother and today I have the priviledge to be his Best Man. I was a little nervous of taking on this job and I did of sub-contracting it to Ian, however I've had time to consider what I might say, unlike a friends wedding when I was asked to do the Best Man's speech with a few minutes notice.  First of all I feel I must thank Burten for the manner in which he conducted the marriage service, it was dignified and reverential. Thank you very much Keith.</p>

<p>The next two persons who should receive our gratitude  are Angela and Kirsten for finding such a delightful venue for today's ceremony The church was intimate and only a few yards away from where we are sitting now. They also selected a delicious menu and for all of us this has been a truly memorable occasion.</p>

<p>Just after Christmas my family were invited to join Kirstens family for lunch where we met Iain, Katy and Owain. We got on like a house on fire and thanks to Angela and Kirsten we had a most excellent meal which augurs we for matthew although he is a good cook himself. Actually Matt is pretty well house trained, whenever he comes to visit me the place is always cleaner when he leaves, infact I think he choose this cosy venue so the washing up wouldn't take him to long - we'll make sure we stack the plates Matt.</p>

<p>When Matthew first introduced Kirsten to us to us on a weekend visit we all took to her with a warmth that has grown to what we have witnessed today and we sincerly welcome her into our family  - I'm sorry Kirsten you jut can't have Matthew. Matthew now has a mother in law and I have no doubts that he and Angela will have no difficulty in getting on together, unlike a friend of mine whose mother in law who was employed by Scottish Tourist board to swim up and down Loch Ness. I think there was a sighting of her recently.</p>

<p>Writing a speech about Matthew proved to be quite a tricky job as on the surface he's squeaky clean and Captain sensible, which makes me wonder why they got the beautiful classic Jaguar for their wedding car - I would of thought he would have gone for the Ford Focus which has much better mpg, safety record and the back seats fold down should they get tired on the way back and need a nap.</p>

<p>I did think about talking about Matt's past female exploits but that didn't seem appropriate, so that can go (rip of a very small strip at bottom of page) or his wild partying when younger, again not appropriate (rip of a very small strip at bottom of page).</p>

<p>Since Matt and Kirsten announced their engagement I've started observing them a little closer and I'd have to say that they make a very harmonious couple. There was one thing though, very small, but something that Kirsten might want to keep an eye on and nip it in the bud if need be. Last year Kirsten, Matt and myself did a grueling 19 mile hike to Half Dome in Yosemite valley, we starting at 7am on the trail and acsended the 5000' to the base of the done by mid afternoon. Kirten decided not to do the final acsent which was very steep and dangerous, each year taking a few unfortunate lives. Matt started with me but about a quarter of the way he turned to me and said that he ought to keep Kirsten company, at first I thought well that's very galant of him and then I thought or was it because he was SCARED... anyway Kirsten just something to keep an eye out for....</p> 

<p>I have to say that on that hike Kirsten proved to be a great trooper, she knew Matt & I wanted to get to the top and even though Kirsten was totally exhausted, you kept on [looking at Kirsten] - I was very impressed by your great strength of personality, a trait I bet runs through the Allen family.</p>

<p>On a visit to see me earlier this year I think I may have discovered the magic spell behind their great relationship, Kirten gets a 10% discount in the local camping store and Matt get's cheap flight - for the adventurous travelling couple that's not a bad combination.</p>

<p>Also on their trip this year, Matthew learnt maybe his first lesson of married life... young ladies swiming naked in the lake are out of bounds, sorry mate no peeking allowed... unfortunaley for Kirsten there were no young men in the lake for her lesson. </p>

<p>Before I wrap up a little background about the family you're marrying into Kirsten, amongst the boys we've had for as long as I can remember the philosophy, "only the best for the Linnards", it didn't matter what it is, if we could afford the best we'd buy it even if it was more than we needed, that said I hope when Matthew picked you to be his wife Kirsten he had that same philosphy in mind.</p> 

<p>Six of the best - violin bow</p>
<p>Ian payed Matt to go to his piano lessons</p>
<p>Various toasts...</p>
